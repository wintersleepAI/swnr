The caster may lay one single-sentence command on the target that is neither suicidal, indefinitely imprecise, nor likely physically impossible for them to comply with. Thus, the caster could geas a man to kill his son or never seek to harm his lord, but he could not reasonably command a peasant to become king or bind someone to forever after comply with a master&rsquo;s arbitrary commands. If the target then defies that geas or unreasonably delays its execution, they suffer an agonizing progressive wasting disease that will inevitably kill them in 1d6 weeks, applying -2 to their hit rolls and -1 to skill checks for each week that passes and halving their maximum hit points. If they again begin complying with the geas afterwards or if the curse is lifted, the disease halts and reverses itself at the same rate it progressed. An active target can make a Mental save to resist this spell, but they cannot if they are restrained, unconscious, or otherwise subdued. The curse lasts until dispelled or the caster lifts it.</p>",

In extremis, the caster can make such a line as part of a Move action, tracing it out or scattering powder as they go. The line itself may be no longer than twenty feet per caster level, and may be straight or curved as the caster wishes. Once it has been drawn, this spell may be cast, empowering the line with the ability to ward off a particular target and prevent them or their powers from crossing or being made to cross the line, as if it were a physical wall. The caster can nominate any kind of target to be warded that could be distinguished without need for knowing their thoughts, such as &ldquo;humans&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-humans&rdquo; or &ldquo;men wearing the livery of the baron&rdquo;. The barrier extends a hundred feet upward and ten feet downward and blocks any attack or magical power used by those warded. If the excluded creatures are attacked or targeted by powers from the other side of the barrier, however, the entire field shatters. The barrier lasts until dispelled, the caster drops it, or until one hour has passed per caster level.</p>",

When unarmed, your attacks count as weapons that use either Str or Dex as their modifier, use Punch or Stab as the skill, do 1d8 damage, and have a Shock value of 2/AC 13. These unarmed attacks can harm even creatures immune to non-magical weapons. The damage and Shock of these weapons gains a +1 bonus at level 3, a +2 bonus at level 6, and a +3 bonus at level 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1: </strong>@UUID[Compendium.wwn.adventuring-gear.Item.CzC1LEcVLxUttB6A]{Natural Weaponry (L1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Level 3:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.wwn.adventuring-gear.Item.Rsv5N5xdCvF9UHp4]{Natural Weaponry (L3)}</p>\n<p><strong>Level 6:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.wwn.adventuring-gear.Item.uqZvgESnCfhw1eY0]{Natural Weaponry (L6)}</p>\n<p><strong>Level 9:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.wwn.adventuring-gear.Item.Un4Wi6C3dmuFhyLu]{Natural Weaponry (L9)}</p>",
