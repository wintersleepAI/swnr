        Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can create, only the richest modern worlds can afford to fabricate these massive engines of war. Even those worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at expending such a tremendous amount of money on a single ship.
        Those that do build battleships do so for a reason. The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require hunter-killer cruisers to disable them. 
        The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it is only a single ship… a single, extremely expensive ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time, and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it.

        Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4 military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete it.

        Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic armor might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required.

        These sophisticated docking bays provide all the necessary tools
        and support for launching a starship from the mother craft. They are
        rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers, but some
        cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay
        allows room for one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the carried
