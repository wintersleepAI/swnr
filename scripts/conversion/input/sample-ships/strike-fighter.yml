    The standard drill-capable fighter craft of most TL4
    polities, this model retains a spike drive instead of replacing
    it with a cheaper systems drive. While the lone
    pilot would have to be desperate and heavily drugged
    to make an entire spike drill solo, it remains an option
    when no larger craft is available.

    This particular model is equipped with a reaper
    battery for dealing with small, lightly-armored civilian
    ships. “Bomber”-type fighters usually replace this
    with a fractal impact charge to threaten larger warships,
    while fighters built to dogfight their peers favor fitting
    a multifocal laser.

        Stepped tapping of the spike drive power plant
        allows for the emission of a torrent of charged
        particles. The particles have very little armor
        penetration, but can fry a small ship's power grid
        in a strike or two.

        This fitting must be put in place when the ship is built, and cannot be installed on cruiser-class or larger ships. A ship designed for atmospheric flight can land on most solid or aqueous surfaces.
