  description: >-
        The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded frontier navies, a corvette is a true warship, albeit of a minimal size. While it is unable to land on worlds with standard gravity, its cargo lighter allows crew and cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its ex- tended stores allow for more than four months of field operation under normal crew parameters.
        Most pirates flying reworked free merchants or stolen patrol boats will turn tail as soon as a cor- vette shows up in the region. Good armor, multiple ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make a corvette a death sentence to most stellar ruffians, and even when a pirate wolf pack can bring one down, it usually comes at the cost of crippling damage.
        The model depicted here is standard for anti-pi- racy and basic system defense missions. Against cruis- er-class warships, however, this corvette’s weapons have insufficient armor penetration to seriously threat- en such a major warship.

        A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1 spike drive with additional phase filters and power throughput refinements. A captain needs buy only the final grade of drive desired. He does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that cannot be built most modern worlds.

        Cruisers and larger craft can’t land on planetary bodies, so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to a standard pressurized cargo container holding up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These containers are usually collapsible and take up no significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they’re not simply disposable cargo shells. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.

        Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures can be used to forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided the target’s engines have been disabled.

        Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4 military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete it.

        Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic armor might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is restocked.
