  description: >-
        The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the fleet cruiser is a ship-eating monster compared to its smaller brethren in the navy. Only prosperous polities can build such powerful ships, and even they sometimes find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of small craft rather than a few heavily-armed cruisers. 

        The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily- armored hull. Only special hunter-killer ships fitted with armor-piercing weaponry have any real chance of penetrating the cruiser’s thick skin. Those weapons are almost always more bulky and power-hungry than their peer weapons, so enemy polities must usually choose between building small ships that are very effective at defeating other small ships, or building hunter-killers that can threaten cruisers but are at a disadvantage against their less specialized brethren.

        A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1 spike drive with additional phase filters and power throughput refinements. A captain needs buy only the final grade of drive desired. He does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that cannot be built most modern worlds.

        Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4 military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete it.

        Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic armor might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is restocked.
