    <p>The power of the precog extends to dictating future events that directly
    involve them. As a Main Action, the precognitive PC may make one prediction
    involving their personal future or future condition within the next year.
    Provided they take reasonable measures to enable this prediction, that no
    direct resistance is mounted by an enemy, and that the prediction doesnâ€™t
    seem highly improbable to the GM, it will come to pass. The adept must
    Commit Effort when this power is used, and the Effort remains Committed
    until the prophecy comes to pass or is abandoned. This ability cannot be
    used more than once per month and only one prophecy may be active at a
    time.</p>
