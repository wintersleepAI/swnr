    <p>The psychicâ€™s <em>Oracle</em> power automatically triggers as an Instant
    action moments before some unexpected danger or ambush, giving the precog a
    brief vision of the impending hazard. This warning comes just in time to
    avoid springing a trap or to negate combat surprise for the precog and their
    companions. If the psychic does not immediately Commit Effort for the day,
    this sense goes numb and this technique cannot be used for the rest of the
    day.</p>
