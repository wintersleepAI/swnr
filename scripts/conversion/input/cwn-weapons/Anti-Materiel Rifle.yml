  description: >-
    Anti-materiel rifles have encountered something of a renaissance with the ubiquity
    of armored drones and heavily cybered combatants. While not suitable for downing
    tanks or other heavily armored vehicles, their 20mm rounds are more than sufficient
    to punch through lighter armor plating, concrete walls, and full body conversion
    cyborgs. Use of a secure firing rest is recommended for best results. This weapon's
    Trauma Die can inflict Traumatic Hits on drones, vehicles, and other machines.
