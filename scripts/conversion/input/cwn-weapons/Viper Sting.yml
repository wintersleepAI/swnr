  description: >-
    A tool of assassins, a Viper Sting is a fang, fingernail needle, palm injector,
    or more exotic implement for injecting an unsuspecting target with a drug of the
    user's choice. A Viper Sting can be loaded with up to four doses of pharmaceuticals,
    dispensed as the user wishes. If loaded with a toxin, it does 1d12 damage with
    a 1d10/x3 Trauma Die. If a tranquilizer is used, the damage is the same, but unconsciousness
    will result instead of death. A Viper Sting can only be effectively used as part
    of an Execution Attack, as an alert opponent can avoid it easily. This cyber inflicts
    a -2 penalty on any check to detect its presence.
