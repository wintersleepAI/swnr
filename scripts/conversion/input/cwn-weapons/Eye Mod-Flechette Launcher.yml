  description: >-
    A holdout weapon designed for surprise short-ranged attacks, this eye has been
    loaded with a small explosive flechette. It has the statistics of a light pistol,
    has a range of 10 meters, and requires a Main Action to reload its single-round
    magazine. If used against a target in melee range who does not suspect its existence,
    a normal hit roll is made; on a miss, it does full normal damage anyway, and on
    a hit, the damage is doubled. It can be used for Execution Attacks.
