  description: >-
    Shotguns of various stripes can be found under the counter of practically every
    bar and shop in a slum. Simple double-barrel models can be made by any home gunsmith
    with a pulse, but the finer tolerances and more elaborate machining of a burst-fire
    capable combat shotgun leaves them as a more selective product. Ranges and damages
    given are for shot shells; slugs double their normal and extreme ranges but apply
    a -1 penalty to hit rolls.
