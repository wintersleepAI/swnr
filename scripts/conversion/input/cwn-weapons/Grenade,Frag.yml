  description: >-
    Grenades may be thrown at a point within range and always target AC 10. On a miss,
    the grenade bounces 1d10 meters in a random direction before exploding. Grenades
    have a 5-meter radius of effect. Frag grenades inflict 2d6 damage on all victims
    in range, plus the chance for a Traumatic Hit. An Evasion save can halve a frag
    grenade's damage, and each point of melee AC the target has above 14 reduces the
    final damage total by one point, possibly down to zero.
