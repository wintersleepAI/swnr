  description: >-
    Heavy machine guns are old tech, but reliable. Without a fixed firing position
    or vehicle mount, however, their recoil makes them almost uncontrollable. Due
    to the mass of lead involved in firing an HMG, each 'round' of its ammunition
    costs $100 and counts as a full item of encumbrance. This weapon's Trauma Die
    can inflict Traumatic Hits on drones, vehicles, and other machines.
