  description: >-
    Automatic rifles include a large range of barely man-portable firearms designed
    to hurl vast amounts of lead through the air, and unlike smaller firearms, they
    can use suppressive fire if properly braced. Ammunition for these guns comes in
    belts or boxes. The mag rating reflects how many rounds the weapon can fire before
    needing a refill, with each 'round' costing $50 worth of ammunition. The compactness
    of their loaded magazines still only counts as one item, however.
