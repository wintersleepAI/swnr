  description: "Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weapons are available\
    \ almost anywhere on the street. Particularly impoverished gangers sometimes fashion\
    \ makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better can\u2019t be obtained.\
    \ Such weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls\
    \ due to their ungainly make."
