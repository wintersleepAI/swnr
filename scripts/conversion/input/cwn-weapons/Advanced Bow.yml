  description: >-
    Advanced bows are used by a few specialists who prefer the near-silence that modern
    composites provide or the massive blood loss induced by a modern fractal broadhead
    carried on a fifty-gram arrow. This weapon can be reloaded with a Move action,
    or an On Turn if the user has at least Shoot-1 skill.
