  description: >-
    Land mines come in anti-personnel and anti-vehicle flavors. The first activates
    on any human-sized approach within 1 meter, inflicting damage in a 2-meter radius
    with an Evasion save for half. Anti-vehicle mines can only be activated by vehicular
    levels of ground pressure or vehicle-sized proximate metal masses, but do their
    damage in a 5-meter radius. Humans get an Evasion save for half damage in either
    case. This weapon's Trauma Die can inflict Traumatic Hits on drones, vehicles,
    and other machines.
