  description: >-
    Rocket launchers include a wide variety of single-shot disposable launchers. Their
    general imprecision forces a -4 hit penalty against human-sized targets, but they
    inflict frag grenade damage on any target within 5 meters of the rocket's landing
    point. Specialized anti-armor warheads lose this frag grenade bonus, but do double
    damage to vehicles or obstacles. Operators who intend to take down enemy vehicles
    favor them for their effectiveness in that role. This weapon's Trauma Die can
    inflict Traumatic Hits on drones, vehicles, and other machines.
