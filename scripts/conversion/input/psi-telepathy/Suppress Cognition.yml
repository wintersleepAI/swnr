    <p>Through intense focus, the telepath can make the target of a
    <em>Telepathic Contact</em> simply not think about something, whether thatâ€™s
    the presence of the telepath, the possibility of committing violence, the
    absence of important documentation, or any other single potential action or
    one specific person. This technique requires the psychic to Commit Effort
    for the scene as a Main Action. The target gets a Mental saving throw to
    resist this power and become immune to it for the scene. If failed, the
    thought remains unthinkable for the rest of the scene unless the target
    perceives physical danger or a traumatic threat to something they prize
    highly. In that case, the block instantly dissolves and cannot be
    re-established during the scene. Once the effect ends, the target will
    remain oblivious to their temporary fugue unless it is brought to their
    attention somehow.</p>
