    <p>The telepath is practiced at opening a <em>Telepathic Contact</em>, and
    need only Commit Effort for the scene to do so, instead of Committing Effort
    for the day. If contacting an ally who has practiced the process with the
    psychic for at least a week, opening the contact normally requires no Effort
    at all. In both cases, if the telepath chooses to Commit Effort for the day,
    they can open a <em>Telepathic Contact</em> as an Instant action rather than
    a Main Action.</p>
