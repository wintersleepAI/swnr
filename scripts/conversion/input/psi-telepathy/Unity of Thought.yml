    <p>The telepath becomes exceptionally skilled at weaving together multiple
    allied minds. When they establish a <em>Telepathic Contact</em> with a
    willing ally they may bind up to six willing participants into the same
    contact without further Effort. This multi-person link is relatively
    shallow, and allows only the Instant exchange of thoughts, images, and
    sensory impressions. While under its effect, every participant knows the
    exact location and condition of all others, and uses the best Initiative
    roll of any of them if combat commences. At the table, up to five minutes of
    discussion and coordination among the players can be arranged each round
    without incurring delays for the PCs. Every combat turn, one gestalt member
    of the psychicâ€™s choice gets an extra round of action to represent the
    benefits of the perfect coordination of the group. The psychic cannot gain
    this bonus round himself. The telepathic link lasts as long as the psychic
    initiates no new <em>Telepathic Contact</em>, and it has a range that
    extends to any point within a solar system.</p>
