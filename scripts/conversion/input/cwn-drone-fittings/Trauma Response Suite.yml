  description: >-
    An array of injectors, scalpels, sutures, and trauma chems are built into the
    drone, allowing it to function as a medkit and make Heal skill checks for a medically-competent
    pilot or an on-site doc in need of a kit. Such medical efforts require a Main
    Action from the pilot as usual, and flying drones apply a -2 penalty to the skill
    check due to their innate instability. Up to six pharmaceutical doses of the pilot`s
    choice can be loaded into the drone.
