    Most commonly installed on small ground drones, this web can be armed as a Main
    Action by the pilot. Until disarmed, any attempt to grab or pick up the drone
    automatically inflicts 2d6 non-lethal electrical damage on the grabber. This shock
    continues each round as long as the drone is held, with up to 5 discharges total
    before the battery must be recharged. The firm contact required makes it impractical
    to use the web as an offensive weapon.
