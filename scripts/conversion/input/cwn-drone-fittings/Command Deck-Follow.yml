    The drone is equipped with minimal autonomous pursuit capabilities. As a Main
    Action, the drone can be ordered to follow a particular visible target at a given
    distance at either half or full speed. If half speed, it will use its Move action
    to follow, and full speed will use both Move and Main Actions. Following can be
    ended as an On Turn command.
