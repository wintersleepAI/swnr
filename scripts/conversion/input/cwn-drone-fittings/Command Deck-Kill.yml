  description: >-
    The drone has autonomous attack routines wired into it. As a Main Action, it can
    be ordered to kill one specific visible target. If the target is in range of its
    weapons, it will use its Main Action to attack; if no additional fittings are
    added, its autonomous attacks have a total hit bonus of +2. The drone will not
    automatically move to follow or engage its target or otherwise position itself
    tactically unless directly piloted to do so or operating under the Follow command.
