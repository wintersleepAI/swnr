  description: >-
    Most flying drones have an effective ceiling of 1,000 meters if there are no scramblers
    to lessen the effective control range. This unit increases a flying drone`s maximum
    altitude to 5,000 meters, making most effectively invisible to ordinary sight.
    Such height does, however, make it extremely conspicuous to aerial scanners used
    by city law enforcement and high-security corp buildings. The speed of their response
    will depend on the drone`s apparent threat.
