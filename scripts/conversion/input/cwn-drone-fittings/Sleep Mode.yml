    Sleep mode can be enabled with a Main Action command or ended with an On Turn
    command. While in sleep mode, a drone cannot fly, move, or perform actions, but
    it will continue to communicate with the pilot and observe its surroundings. A
    day of sleep mode counts as ten minutes of ordinary operation for battery drain
    purposes.
