  description: >-
    Usable only on ground-based drones of Enc 3 or less, this fitting allows the drone
    to climb sheer surfaces at its normal movement rate, assuming the surface is sturdy
    enough to bear its weight. Most high-security buildings are constructed with veneers
    that defeat this fitting, but ordinary structures seldom have such measures.
