  description: >-
    Usable only by flying drones of Enc 3 size or greater, this fitting allows a human-sized
    mass to use the drone as a form of parachute-glider. As a Main Action, a user
    can leap off a high place after grabbing the drone and descend safely to the ground
    at a distance as far from the initial point as that point was above the ground.
    Similar weights can be sent safely to the ground in the same way.
