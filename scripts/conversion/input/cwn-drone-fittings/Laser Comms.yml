  description: >-
    This fitting provides both a set of universal transceiver plug-ins and a laser
    comm hub for the drone. Provided the PCs are in line of sight of the drone, normal
    radio-wave based comms can be switched to lasers, providing uncrackable, electromagnetically-inaudible
    communications within the group. Radio comms can still be used as needed.
