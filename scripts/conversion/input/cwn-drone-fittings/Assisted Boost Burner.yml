  description: >-
    The drone is equipped with reactive chemical booster that can be ignited to give
    it a very brief burst of tremendous speed. When activated as a Move action, the
    burner launches the drone up to 500 meters in a straight line. The boost is not
    precise enough to use as an aimed weapon, but solid obstacles in front of the
    drone will suffer half the drone`s HP in damage and inflict all of theirs on the
    drone. The burner functions only once before it require a scene to regenerate
    its charge.
