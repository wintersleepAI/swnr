    With a Main Action command to detonate, the drone will explode, doing 3d6 damage
    to anyone within ten meters, with an Evasion save for half. Subjects behind solid
    cover further halve the damage. Drones reduced to zero hit points are too badly
    damaged to respond to detonation commands.
