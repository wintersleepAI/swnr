  description: >-
    Functioning only for ground based drones of Enc 3 or greater, the drone is equipped
    with a retractable litter that can fit one human patient, along with manipulators
    sufficient to get a prone victim onto the litter with a Main Action. Onboard meds
    allow for remote Heal skill checks to stabilize a Mortally Wounded target, with
    one attempt allowed as part of the loading action. A loaded patient can`t be harmed
    until the drone is destroyed or opens the litter, but if the drone dies, the patient
    does too. As a Main Action, the drone can be ordered to autonomously take the
    patient to a particular location. As an On Turn action, an onboard transmitter
    can also place a call for medical assistance to a pre-arranged number.
