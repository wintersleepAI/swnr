    An entire second vehicle can be mounted with this fitting, Medium vehicles taking
    Small parasites and Large ones taking Small or Medium. Adding a mount for a Small
    vehicle takes up 3 Mass while a Medium one takes 6. Modifying a vehicle to be
    mounted adds 10% to its base cost, but it can be launched even while the parent
    vehicle is underway. These parasite vehicles are destroyed if the parent is; otherwise,
    they take only half the damage the parent takes.
