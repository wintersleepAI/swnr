    For up to two hours per day the vehicle can seal itself entirely from the outside
    atmosphere, with internal air tanks and positive pressure to keep out external
    toxins. At all times it can maintain a comfortable interior temperature in any
    terrestrial climate. Aircraft do not need this fitting to function normally at
    high altitudes.
