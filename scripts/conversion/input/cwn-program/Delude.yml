    Spoof a device with false sensor input. A camera can be made to record nonexistent
    scenes, a minefield can be made to see phantom intrusions, a drone can feed the
    operator false visuals, and a turret can be made to mistake friends for foes.
    This Verb can't control a device directly, however, and must rely on feeding it
    false sensor data.
