    A cybernetic system in a visible subject within 30 meters with no significant
    obstacles to line of sight. Unlike most Subjects, it's not necessary for a hacker
    to manifest an avatar inside the target node to affect cyber systems; they can
    launch their program directly at it, and the system itself need not be visible
    on the target's body. Given the difficulty of affecting cyber wirelessly, many
    hackers prefer to use more specific Subjects for a +1 bonus, such as Nerve Cyber
    or Limb Cyber.
