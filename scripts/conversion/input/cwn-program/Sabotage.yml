    Cause a physical device or cyberware system to damage itself through violent movement
    or self-destructive current surges. Devices smaller than a car will usually be
    disabled until repaired. Cyberware users do not take damage, but must make two
    Physical saves to resist the effect; if they fail both, the targeted system is
    disabled until the next maintenance, and if they fail one, it's frozen for one
    round. A device or cyber can be targeted by this Verb only once per scene.
