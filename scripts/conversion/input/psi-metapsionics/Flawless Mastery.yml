    <p>When this technique is learned, the adept may choose one technique from
    any discipline they know. That technique no longer requires Effort to be
    Committed in any way, though other techniques that augment it may still
    exact a cost. Mastered <em>Psychic Static</em>, for example, can expend an
    effectively unlimited amount of effort. If the technique has a duration
    based on Committed Effort then it lasts until the metapsion chooses to end
    it or is killed. This technique may only be mastered once, though the
    perfected technique may be changed with a month of meditation and
    practice.</p>
