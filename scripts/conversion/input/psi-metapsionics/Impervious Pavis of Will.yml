    <p>When this technique is learned, the metapsion must choose a discipline.
    They then become entirely immune to unwanted powers from that discipline;
    they and their abilities are simply not valid targets for purposes of that
    disciplineâ€™s powers unless the adept chooses to be affected. By Committing
    Effort for the day as an Instant action, they can extend this immunity for a
    scene to all allies within 50 meters. This technique may be learned more
    than once, and any shared protection applies to all disciplines negated by
    the adept.</p>
