    <p>An expert metapsion can modulate and temper the metadimensional energy
    that surges through an untrained psychic’s mind. This “safety buffer” allows
    the novice to experiment with their abilities and gradually develop the
    control they need to channel their powers without causing permanent brain
    damage. Without this technique, it is virtually impossible to turn a normal
    with untapped potential into a trained psychic.</p><p>An adept with
    Metapsionics-3 skill can train up to ten pupils at once. One with
    Metapsionics-4 can train up to one hundred. It requires only a week to train
    a potential in ways to avoid accidentally triggering their powers and
    suffering the damage that follows, but actually teaching them to use their
    powers effectively takes anywhere from one to four years depending on their
    natural aptitude and the availability of other psychics willing to assist
    the metapsion in the training process.</p>
