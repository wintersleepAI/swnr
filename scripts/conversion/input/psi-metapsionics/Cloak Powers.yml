    <p>The metapsion can conceal their own psychic abilities from metapsionic
    senses. They must Commit Effort for as long as they wish to cloak their
    powers. While hidden, only a metapsion with equal or higher skill in
    Metapsionics can detect their abilities with their level-0 or level-2
    <em>Psychic Refinement</em> abilities. In such cases, an opposed
    Wis/Metapsionics roll is made between the metapsion and the investigator. If
    the investigator wins, the cloak is pierced, while if the metapsion wins,
    the investigatorâ€™s <em>Psychic Refinement</em> remains oblivious.</p>
