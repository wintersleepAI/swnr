    <p>Expert teleporters can be infuriatingly difficult to pin down. By
    Committing an additional Effort for the day as an Instant action, the adept
    can use <em>Personal Apportation</em> as an On Turn action, even if they’ve
    already used it once this round. Apporting itself costs whatever Effort it
    normally would, in addition to any techniques that augment it. <em>Rift
    Reduplication</em> can only be triggered once per round. </p><p>If the adept
    uses their powers to teleport into a location, perform an action, and then
    use <em>Rift Reduplication</em> to teleport back out, onlookers in the area
    will not have time to react to their action or attack the adept unless the
    onlookers have held their action explicitly to counter the psychic. Enemies
    who hold their action this way waste it entirely if the psychic does not
    give them a chance to attack or otherwise interfere. Such a lightning strike
    may be surprising to onlookers, but it doesn’t allow enough preparation time
    to count as an Execution Attack as described on page 52.</p>
