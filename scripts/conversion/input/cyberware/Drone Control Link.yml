    Most often found among military bot wranglers, civilians can also get a drone
    control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting of drones and other robotic units.
    Users of a link can issue commands to a drone as a Move action instead of a Main Action.
    A single drone can only receive one command per round, however. Aside from this ease
    of command, someone with an implanted rig can "look" through a piloted drone's sensors
    as an Instant action, and a drone is never considered to be out of control even
    if the pilot doesn't spend an action controlling it. A link can maintain a connection
    with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program skill.
