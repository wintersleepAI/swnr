    Ocular adjustments to the wearer allow them to see clearly at any light level short of
    perfect darkness, in addition to giving them thermal vision that can easily distinguish shapes and
    distance even in the total absence of light. Dangerous radiation and lasers tuned outside the range
    of visible light are also visible to the user. Nearby radio transmissions can be seen as if they were
    visual flares of color. The system cannot translate these transmissions, only alert the user to them.
