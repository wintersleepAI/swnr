    Usually implanted somewhere in the torso, a holdout cavity is a small recess shaped
    into the wearer’s body and designed to be overlooked by most standard forms of medical or security scanning.
    It automatically defeats a security inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and
    even advanced tech requires careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it.
    The cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and is opened and shut by the user’s mental command.
