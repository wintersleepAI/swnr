    Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and numerous internal organs can be replicated by
    postech medical science. These prosthetics can provide a good approximation of the sense of
    touch, and are usually impossible to distinguish from ordinary limbs without close inspection.
    Pretech-level worlds tend to prefer actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with access only
    to ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to be grateful to prosthetics.
