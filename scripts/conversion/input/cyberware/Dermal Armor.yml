    A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection against
    impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to anything short of a medical examination.
    Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee
    weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs five times as much grants even more protection,
    rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive weapons as if they were wearing powered armor.
  disabled: false
