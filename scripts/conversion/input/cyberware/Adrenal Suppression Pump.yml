    Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user
    when activated while exciting the userâ€™s perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold,
    dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is
    engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain
    damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty
    on all social skill checks while the unit is active, and it requires five rounds to toggle it.
