  description: >-
    Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are embedded in the subjectâ€™s hands and feet as part
    of this complex surgery. While they are too weak to allow levitation or damping fall damage, they
    can twist localized gravity around those limbs to anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable
    of bearing their weight. As a result, the user can freely run or climb up or down sheer surfaces at
    their normal movement rate, carrying no more than their normal maximum encumbrance.
  disabled: false
  effect: Can climb sheer surfaces as if they were flat
