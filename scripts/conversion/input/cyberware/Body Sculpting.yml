    Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body
    sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced
    medical services. After a week of alterations and treatments a subjectâ€™s
    external appearance can be desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment
    that costs ten times as much can involve extensive DNA reprogramming
    to change the subject at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable
    and allowing female-targeted shapes to bear offspring. This TL5 treatment is not reversible,
    and any further major alterations to the subject require further permanent System Strain.
