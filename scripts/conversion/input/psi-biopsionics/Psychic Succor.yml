    <p>The adept’s touch stabilizes critically-wounded organisms. More
    sophisticated practitioners can heal tissue injuries, though curing
    diseases, detoxifying poisons, and fixing congenital deformities require
    additional techniques. Each use of <em>Psychic Succor</em> adds one point of
    System Strain to the target, or two points if they were mortally wounded at
    the time.</p><p>Activating <em>Psychic Succor</em> requires the biopsion to
    Commit Effort for the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the
    rest of that scene without Committing Effort again.</p><p>Level-0: The
    psychic’s touch can automatically stabilize a mortally-wounded target as a
    Main Action. This power must be used on a target within six rounds of their
    collapse, and does not function on targets that have been decapitated or
    killed by Heavy weapons. It’s the GM’s decision as to whether a target is
    intact enough for this power to work.</p><p>Level-1: As level-0, and heal
    1d6+1 hit points of damage. If used on a mortally-wounded target, they
    revive with the rolled hit points and can act normally on the next
    round.</p><p>Level-2: As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 hit points
    instead.</p><p>Level-3: As level-2, but healing 2d6+6 hit points
    instead.</p><p>Level-4: As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 hit points
    instead.</p>
