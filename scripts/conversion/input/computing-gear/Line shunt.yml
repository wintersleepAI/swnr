    Line shunt: These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness,
    with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually anything and a
    polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift color to blend
    with its surroundings. One or more line shunts must be applied at specific
    locations within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of
    computerized systems. Shunts employ phased energy manipulation tech, and so
    do not need to be directly in contact with a data line but only within a few
    centimeters. Line shunts are single-use, and keep functioning until removed.
