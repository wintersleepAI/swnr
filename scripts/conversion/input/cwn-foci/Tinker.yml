    You have a natural talent for modifying and improving equipment, as given in the
    rules in section 2.8.2.
  level1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you
    to maintain twice as many mods. Vehicle, cyber, and gear mods cost only half their
    usual price in dollars, though experimental component requirements remain the
    same.
  level2: Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for purposes of building and
    maintaining mods and calculating your Maintenance score, up to a maximum of Fix-5.
    Advanced mods require one fewer experimental components to make, down to a minimum
    of zero.
