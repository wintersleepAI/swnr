    While anyone can drive a drone under casual circumstances, your knack for it is
    something unusual.
  level1: Gain Drive and Fix as bonus skills. You acquire or start play with a Remote
    Control Unit cybersystem and its installation. Through connections, scavenging,
    and parts repurpose, you have free drones and their weapons and fittings worth
    no more than the budget given in section 1.6.2. You can repair these drones without
    needing spare parts, and destroyed drones can be replaced with a week's work.
    You always have the equivalent of a drone repair kit on you at no Encumbrance
    cost.
  level2: You can use the Assume Command drone action once per round as an On Turn
    action. Once per scene, gain a bonus Main Action to command a drone. Any drones
    you control gain a +2 bonus to their hit rolls, whether or not you're personally
    firing their weaponry.
