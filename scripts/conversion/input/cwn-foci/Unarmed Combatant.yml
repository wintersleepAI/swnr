    Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives in the grip of the less gifted.
    Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to binding up
    opponents wielding pistols, rifles and similar ranged arms, though you need at
    least one hand free to do so.
  level1: Gain Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed attacks become more dangerous
    as your Punch skill increases. At level-0, they do 1d6 damage. At level-1, they
    do 1d8 damage. At level-2 they do 1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 1d12+1.
    At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality equal to your Punch skill against
    AC 15 or less. While you normally add your Punch skill level to any unarmed damage
    you inflict, don't add it twice to Shock damage. If you choose to strike lethally
    with unarmed attacks, they have a Trauma Die of 1d6 and a Trauma Rating of x2.
  level2: Even on a miss with a Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage, plus
    any Shock that the blow might inflict on the target. Your Trauma Die becomes 1d8
    for lethal attacks.
