    Any skilled medic can implant and maintain cyber systems, but you have a special
    aptitude for the work.
  level1: Gain Fix and Heal as bonus skills. You start play with a cyberdoc kit, and
    you can implant cyberware even if your Heal skill is level-0. You gain a +2 bonus
    on all cyber implant surgery skill checks. If you perform cyber maintenance for
    a person, the delicacy of your adjustments decreases the total System Strain cost
    of their implants by one point until their next maintenance interval.
  level2: The quality of your cyber maintenance improves; the System Strain decrease
    is equal to two points now instead of one. You never fail to install cyberware
    correctly. Once per patient, you can build and install a cyber modification to
    a system as described in section 2.8.2 without any cost in money or experimental
    components, assuming you have the requisite skill levels to build it.
