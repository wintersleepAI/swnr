    You have multiple usable identities registered with corporate and governmental
    databases. These identities are so deeply embedded in the systems that they're
    almost impossible to pry out unless you do something to compromise them.
  level1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can maintain one alternate identity at
    a time per three character levels, rounded up. These identities have their own
    names, backgrounds, criminal records, financial dealings, and bank accounts, and
    will register as authentic to all normal corporate and governmental checks. If
    an identity is compromised or you want a different one, you can replace it with
    a week's work. False identities cannot be important people or involve corporations
    you don't have a Contact in already.
