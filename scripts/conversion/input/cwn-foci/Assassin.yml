  description: >-
    You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in carrying out
    an Execution Attack as described in the rules in section 2.4.7.3.
  level1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no larger than a
    knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including normal
    weapon detection devices. You can draw or produce this object as an On Turn action,
    and your point-blank ranged attacks made from surprise with it cannot miss the
    target.
  level2: You can take a Move action on the same round as you make an Execution Attack,
    closing rapidly with a target before you attack. You may split this Move action
    when making an Execution Attack, taking part of it before you murder your target
    and part of it afterwards. This movement happens too quickly to alert a victim
    or to be hindered by bodyguards not directly in your path.
