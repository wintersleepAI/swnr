    Your mind and body are superbly gifted, but this very excellence leaves you profoundly
    incompatible with most cyber. You cannot accept implants except for minor cosmetic
    ones with an unmodified System Strain cost of zero. If a GM is mixing rules from
    multiple Without Number games, this Focus should not be allowed unless cyberware
    is expected equipment for all PCs. If you're using the deluxe version rules for
    magic, PCs with magical or psychic Edges such as Spellcaster, Summoner, or Graced
    cannot take this Focus.
  level1: Gain any skill as a bonus skill. Pick an attribute; its modifier increases
    by +1, up to a maximum of +3. You can make another such attribute pick at levels
    3, 5, 7, and 10, choosing the same attribute or a different one. While you can
    still suffer Traumatic Hits, you never suffer major injuries as described on page
    41.
  level2: Armsmaster
