    You have a gift with ranged weapons. While this talent most commonly applies to
    guns, it is also applicable to thrown weapons or other ranged weapons that can
    be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of
    the Armsmaster Focus at the same time as Deadeye.
  level1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can Ready a Stowed ranged weapon as an
    Instant action. You may use a rifle or two-handed ranged weapon even when an enemy
    is within melee range, albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may add your Shoot skill
    level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.
  level2: You can reload guns, crossbows, or other slow-loading weapons as an On Turn
    action, provided they don't take more than a round to reload. You can use ranged
    weapons of any size in melee without penalty. Once per scene, as an On Turn action
    when target shooting at an inanimate, non-creature target, you automatically hit
    unless you roll a 2 on your Shoot skill check or the shot is physically impossible.
