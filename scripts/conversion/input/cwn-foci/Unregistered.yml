    Whether by unrecorded birth, database corruption, or sheer luck, you simply do
    not exist in any government or corporate database. If taken with the Many Faces
    Focus, your own identity is lost, but you can create others for your own uses.
    If this Focus is taken after character creation, it means your existing records
    have become hopelessly corrupted and lost.",You have no government or corporate
    database records associated with you
  level1: ' and it is almost impossible to add any such records without them ending
    up corrupted or deleted within a week. Human beings can remember you'
  level2: ' but they can''t rely on computerized records to keep track of you or your
    activities. You can keep money on credit chips or in cash'
