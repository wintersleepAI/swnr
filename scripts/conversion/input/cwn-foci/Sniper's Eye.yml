    You are an expert at placing a bullet or arrow on an unsuspecting target. These
    special benefits only apply when making an Execution Attack with a gun, bow, or
    thrown weapon, as described in section 2.4.7.3.
  level1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a skill check for a ranged Execution
    Attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
  level2: You don't miss ranged Execution Attacks. A target hit by one takes a -4
    penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal injury. Even if
    the save is successful, the target takes double the normal damage inflicted by
    the attack.
