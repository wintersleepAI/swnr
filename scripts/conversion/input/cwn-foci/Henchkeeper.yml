  description: "You have a distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly\
    \ do your bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement,\
    \ sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A henchman\
    \ obtained with this Focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly betrayed\
    \ or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not \u201Cimportant\u201D people,\
    \ and are usually marginal sorts, criminals, the desperate, or other persons with\
    \ few options.You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional\
    \ henchmen, but these extra hirelings are no more loyal or competent than your\
    \ pay and treatment can purchase."
  level1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within 24 hours of
    arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen
    will not fight except to save their own lives, but will go with you on missions
    and risk great danger to help you. Most corper henchmen will have 5 HP, a +0 attack
    bonus, and a Morale of 7, plus whatever gear they're given. Slum-dwellers and
    other natives of harsh societies will fight as Street Thugs per page 188 if pressed.
    You can have one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have,
    rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible time
    and pick them back up later should you be without a current henchman.
  level2: Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you
    against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural competence
    or their devotion to you, they're treated as a Basic Corp Security from page 186.
    You can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs, but this
    requires that you actually have done them some favor or help that would reasonably
    earn such fierce loyalty.
