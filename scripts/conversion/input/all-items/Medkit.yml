    Medkit: Containing a broad supply of pharmaceuticals, spray bandages, glue
    sutures, and a succinct handbook of injury care, the medkit is designed for
    handling sudden and drastic injuries. It also contains all the necessary
    tools for providing long-term recuperative care for critically injured
    characters. After each day of granting long-term recuperative care, roll 2d6
    per patient treated; on a 12, the kit has run out of some vital
    pharmaceutical and has become useless.
