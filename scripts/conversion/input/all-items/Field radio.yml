    Field Radio: On worlds too primitive to have a comm grid, adventurers often
    fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A single type A cell powers
    them for months of use. Urban or rugged terrain limits their range to about
    two kilometers, while flat plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers.
    Someone with at least Program-0 skill can use the radioâ€™s shortwave
    functionality to communicate with a prepared target at continental distances
    if given ten minutes for tuning.
