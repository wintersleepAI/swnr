    Telekinetic generator: While this device assumes the presence of a trained
    telekinetic, it isnâ€™t strictly psitech, as its operation is quite simple. A
    telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a
    flow of electricity to recharge an attached power cell. Any telekinetic with
    Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of
    concentration. In an emergency, a character with at least Strength 10 can
    operate the generator manually, though they need to succeed on a difficulty
    8 Con/Exert skill check in order to keep up the pace for an hour. Failure
    means that the character must rest for at least an hour before trying again.
    The generator can charge one type A power cell at a time. Communications
    Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible with
    any standard compad. Some planets are less technologically gifted, however,
    or have local conditions that preclude easy wireless communication. Other
    times, the PCs have reason to avoid leaving call logs that might come back
    to haunt them.
