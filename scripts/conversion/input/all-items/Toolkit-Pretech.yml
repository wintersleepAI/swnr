    Toolkits/Pretech: Containing a wide range of necessary tools for a
    particular skill set, toolkits can handle almost any job that doesnâ€™t
    require a full-scale shop or lab. These sophisticated pretech tools are
    necessary for working on advanced TL5 artifacts, and the tools themselves
    are very rare and difficult to obtain.
