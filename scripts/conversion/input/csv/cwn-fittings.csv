Crash Pod,2500,0,2,M,Protects in case of crash,vehicle,"If the vehicle crashes, the occupants can each reroll one failed crash save. If they make any of their saves, their HP can't be reduced below 1 point by the crash."
ECM Emitter,10000,2,0,M,Jams incoming missiles,vehicle,"On a successful hit roll by a headshot pod, rocket launcher, or other long-range guided projectile, the driver can make an opposed Int or Dex/Drive skill check against the attacker's combat skill. On a success, the attacker must reroll their hit roll and take the worst result."
Emissions Cloaking,10000,1,2,S,Radar and thermal near-invisibility,vehicle,"Once per day, for one hour, the vehicle can become almost invisible to infrared or radar. This cloak becomes useless if the vehicle is visually spotted by defenders."
Extra Durability,5000,0,4,M,Increases maximum HP by 25%,vehicle,"The vehicle's maximum hit points increase by 25%, rounded up."
Extra Passengers,2500,0,2,S,Add additional Crew,vehicle,"Small vehicles add 1 Crew, Medium ones add 2, and Large ones add 4. This fitting can be taken multiple times, and any vehicle amenities such as crash pods or living quarters extend to these additional Crew as well."
Field Portable,1000,0,2,S,Break it down into portable components,vehicle,"Only Small or Medium vehicles can take this option, allowing them to be broken down into easily-portable parts packages. Small vehicles turn into 30 items of Encumbrance and Medium ones into 150. Disassembly takes 30 minutes for a Small vehicle and 3 hours for a Medium one, with reassembly taking four times as long."
Ghost Driver,2500,1,1,S,Limited AI driving capabilities,vehicle,"The driver can order the vehicle directly or by radio or phone to go to particular places at particular times or perform other simple, direct actions on a given schedule. The onboard expert system can handle traffic-related challenges, but has no real intelligence to process more complicated problems."
Hardpoint Support,5000,1,1,M,Adds another hardpoint,vehicle,Additional power and structural support enable the addition of a hardpoint.
Jack Control Port,5000,2,0,S,Can drive the vehicle via cranial jack,vehicle,"The vehicle is wired to be controlled through a plugged-in cranial jack as well as a conventional wheel. While jacked in, the driver need only use a Move Action to control the vehicle rather than a Main Action."
"Limpet Mount,Small",5000,0,3,M,Mount a smaller vehicle on it,vehicle,"An entire second vehicle can be mounted with this fitting, Medium vehicles taking Small parasites and Large ones taking Small or Medium. Adding a mount for a Small vehicle takes up 3 Mass while a Medium one takes 6. Modifying a vehicle to be mounted adds 10% to its base cost, but it can be launched even while the parent vehicle is underway. These parasite vehicles are destroyed if the parent is; otherwise, they take only half the damage the parent takes."
"Limpet Mount,Medium",10000,0,6,L,Mount a smaller vehicle on it,vehicle,"An entire second vehicle can be mounted with this fitting, Medium vehicles taking Small parasites and Large ones taking Small or Medium. Adding a mount for a Small vehicle takes up 3 Mass while a Medium one takes 6.

Offroad Package,5000,1,3,L,Enables deep wilderness operation,vehicle,"While any modern vehicle can handle abandoned roads and mostly-flat terrain, this package includes winches, tire armor, chassis reinforcement, and other upgrades needed to go through all but the most impassible terrain."
"Power System,Small",1000,-2,2,S,Adds Power at a cost in Mass,vehicle,This fitting adds extra Power in battery capacity and computing support at the cost of an additional Mass burden.
"Power System,Medium",5000,-4,3,M,Adds Power at a cost in Mass,vehicle,This fitting adds extra Power in battery capacity and computing support at the cost of an additional Mass burden.
"Power System,Large",10000,-8,5,L,Adds Power at a cost in Mass,vehicle,This fitting adds extra Power in battery capacity and computing support at the cost of an additional Mass burden.
Sealed Atmosphere,5000,1,1,M,"Pressurized, temp-controlled interior",vehicle,"For up to two hours per day the vehicle can seal itself entirely from the outside atmosphere, with internal air tanks and positive pressure to keep out external toxins. At all times it can maintain a comfortable interior temperature in any terrestrial climate. Aircraft do not need this fitting to function normally at high altitudes."
Smuggler's Hold,1000,0,1,S,Hidden cargo space,vehicle,"This fitting can be taken more than once, and adds 10 kg of concealed cargo space in Small vehicles, 100 kg in Medium ones, and 400 kg in Large ones.
