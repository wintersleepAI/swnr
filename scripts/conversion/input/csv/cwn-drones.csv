Shintetsu Mouse,500,13,6,1,1,0,1,5,ground,0,"Little more than a fist-sized drive core with wheels, Shintetsu's Mouse is about as small as a functional drone can get with its low-cost technology. Incapable of supporting more than its basic functionality, it still provides eyes and ears for a pilot in a cheap, portable format."
BanTech Roach,1000,13,6,8,8,3,3,10,ground,0,"One of numerous similar models, the BanTech Roach is one of the smaller wheeled drones on the market, popular among pilots who need a little more usable mass and power than a flying drone this size could muster."
Sui Hummingbird,2000,15,6,5,5,2,3,10,fly,0," The Sui Hummingbird is the smallest flight-capable drone of any practical use to most pilots. It has very limited loadout options, but its small size allows for several different drones to be carried by the pilot."
BanTech Sunfish,1000,15,6,8,8,3,3,10,swim,0," BanTech has tried to make an opening in the aquatic drone market with the Sunfish, an easily-portable swimming drone that can still mount a few useful loadout options."
Lem Robotics Pitbull,5000,15,8,15,15,5,5,20,ground,1,"Lem Robotics has sold more than a million of these wheeled patrol drones to megacorps and governments around the world. Needless to say, a significant number of them have fallen into private hands."
NAMU Javelin,10000,16,6,12,12,5,6,20,fly,1,"NAMU's Javelin is a workhorse among operatives in need of a sturdy flying drone with a con -siderable equipment loadout. While bulky, even small-framed pilots can usually carry a packed Javelin along with their usual gear."
Kessler Kerberos,15000,18,8,25,25,6,99,20,ground,3,"Built on a large motorized tricycle chassis, the Kessler Kerberos is one of the largest ground drones  in  general  production.  Most  serve  as urban patrol units for municipal governments, though their heavy armor and sturdy construction have endeared them to operators in need of a heavy gun platform"
Sui Kraken,10000,16,8,20,20,5,99,15,swim,2,"While weighing more than a hundred kilos when fully loaded, Sui's Kraken still fits into the trunk of most car-sized vehicles and can be deployed when aquatic operations are needed."
NAMU Shrike,25000,18,8,20,20,6,99,30,fly,2,"NAMU's largest drone model, the Shrike is most often used in active war zones, though most major corp security hubs keep a wing on hand for drastic situations. Three meters long with meter-wide vector wings, the Shrike can handle a substantial combat load."
