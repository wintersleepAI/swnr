Aesthetic Augmentation Suite,50000,Body,Sight,2,Body sculpt and Cha bonus,"Any standard fleshmod can supply beauty, but an aesthetic augmentation suite provides not only a fleshmod's versatility, but tailored pheromones, vocal harmonizharmers, social cue triggers, and an absolutely inhuman visual perfection. Subjects gain a Charisma score of 14, or a +2 score bonus if already 14 or greater, up to a maximum of 18."
Assisted Glide System,50000,Body,Touch,2,Glide from high launch points,"Retractable nanofiber wings and integral boost jets allow a limited degree of flight for the user of this implant. When leaping from a high place, they gain a flight Move speed of 30m for up to two kilometers before being forced to land. Gaining altitude requires a Dex/ Exert skill check against difficulty 10, however, with failure forcing a landing, and the wings can't carry them more than twice as high as the height they jumped from. By deploying the boost jets and wings as an Instant action, the user can ignore up to a hundred meters of falling damage."
Banshee Module,30000,Body,Medical,1,Mimic voices and stun enemies,"Resonant cavities are designed into the user's torso, along with an advanced amplification system. They can reproduce any sound or voice they have heard before, and at maximum volume can be heard clearly up to five hundred meters away. Once per day, as a Main Action, this sound can be used to shatter normal glass in a ten-meter line in front of the user; creatures without ear protection in this area must make a Physical save or take 2d6 non-lethal damage."
Cybernetic Infrastructure Baseline,20000,Body,Medical,0,Gain Con 12 for cyber purposes,A set of standardized support implants provide a baseline degree of cyber-compatibility to a subject. They can ignore System Strain from cyber implants equal to 12 minus their Constitution score- so a PC with a Constitution of 9 could ignore three points worth of System Strain from cyber implants. PCs with a Con of 12 or more have no use for this system. 
Deadman Circuit,10000,Body,Sight,0.25,Fry cyber without access codes,A common corporate implant to discourage kidnapping and warelegging. Any attempt to remove any of the user's cyber without the right access codes will fry that hardware unless a difficulty 13 Int/Heal skill check is made. 
Dermal Armor/Trauma Shielding,100000,Body,Medical,1,Add +1 to user's Trauma Target,"A system that can only be installed on a user with at least one level of Dermal Armor, the trauma shielding addition adds +1 to the user's Trauma Target. This benefit stacks with any existing Dermal Armor bonus to the roll."
Emergency Stabilization Factor,30000,Body,Medical,1,Automatically stabilize,"When brought to zero hit points by an injury that does not instantly kill them, the user automatically stabilizes, gaining one System Strain, and will regain consciousness at the end of the scene with 1 hit point. If they are already at maximum strain, this cyberware does not function."
Fleshmod,20000,Body,Medical,1,Completely rework your body,"Careful surgery and support implants allow for a complete physical remolding within generally humanoid lines, including alterations of sex, height, cosmetic limbs such as tails or decorative ears, and overall weight. Reproductive ability is not conferred, but rumors persist of experimental mods that can grant even that."
Full Body Conversion,6000000,Body,Sight,0,Become a full body cyborg,"The user's brain and central nervous system are transplanted into a cutting-edge synthetic shell at a cost and difficulty as if this cyber took 4 System Strain. Once converted, the subject has an effective Constitution of 20 for System Strain purpose, but cannot be healed by conventional first aid or medical drugs, requiring ten minutes of repair work with a toolkit to repair any amount of damage, and $250 worth of parts for each hit point to be restored. A full conversion borg no longer requires food, water, air, or sleep, but each day without the latter adds one System Strain due to the mental stress. The conversion requires twelve hours of maintenance every two weeks, and missing it will result in the user's death in 2d6 days unless the omitted maintenance is performed. Current full-body conversion tech is unstable; after 1d4 years, the subject has a cumulative 5% death chance each year. Borgs do not take Major Injuries and gain a +6 bonus to their Trauma Target that stacks with existing bonuses."
Hemosynthetic Filter System,25000,Body,Medical,1,Immune to normal disease/toxin,"A wide-spectrum array of blood scrubbers, intake filters, and microbial barriers grants the user effective immunity to most natural diseases and non-synthetic toxins. Weaponized toxins and certain exotic natural afflictions can still affect the user, but they get a +2 bonus on all saving throws against them. The system automatically alerts the user if they have been exposed to a recognized disease or toxin, whether or not it affects them."
Holdout Cavity,10000,Body,Medical,1,2 Enc. of hidden body space,"A biosculpted torso pocket allows for the air-tight, climate-controlled concealment of 2 Encumbrance worth of items inside the user's body and their easy access with a Main Action. Any given object stored can't be larger than a pistol or a tightly-folded suit of clothing, and the pocket's contents don't count against the user's Encumbrance limit. The pocket's signature is disguised against conventional scanning technology, and it cannot be detected without a manual strip search by a trained examiner."
Medical Support Readout,10000,Body,Medical,0.25,Gain +2 to Heal checks on you,"A diagnostic system is interfaced with the user's biological processes, allowing a realtime analysis of their current health and any significant injuries. Aside from immediately alerting the user when they are poisoned, diseased, or injured, it grants any healing or medical support skill check a +2 bonus thanks to the diagnostic information and increases first aid or drug healing by +2 HP per application."
Recovery Support Unit,30000,Body,Medical,1,Gain 4 System Strain for heals,A number of support systems and blood purification filters are installed. The user can absorb up to four points of System Strain incurred from healing or wound stabilization effects; this is a separate pool that recovers one point every night at the same time as the user's natural System Strain recovers. 
Redundant Systems,15000,Body,Medical,1,Sacrifice to avoid Major Injury,"Several pieces of prosthetic support cyber are preemptively installed to mitigate future trauma. When the user takes a Major Injury, they may instead choose to have the Redundant Systems critically damaged instead of accepting the major injury roll result. Redundant Systems can be installed more than once, but the System Strain inflicted increases by one point each time."
Retribution Shield,50000,Body,Touch,1,Burst to harm melee targets,"Numerous small projectile launchers are embedded under synthetic skin. When triggered as an On Turn action, the user gains one System Strain to launch a cloud of shrapnel around them, acting as ground zero of a frag grenade explosion. The user has enough targeting control to avoid hitting allies in range. If grappling or grappled at the time, their opponent automatically takes maximum damage. Reloading the Retribution Shield takes five minutes, and the system will not function if the user is wearing suit-grade armor. Lesser armor can usually be tailored to expose adequate amounts of skin."
Therapeutic Control Dampers,25000,Body,Medical,1,Suppress an implant side-effect,"A set of customized medical and therapeutic implants are used to control the side-effects of a partially-successful cyberware implant. For each implantation of this system, the user can choose to ignore one implant side-effect they currently suffer. The skill check to implant this system can fail, but it never induces any side effects on its own."
Titan Gun System,100000,Body,Sight,1,Mount a Heavy weapon,"Usable only by full body conversion cyborgs or subjects with a Strength score of 18, this mount allows the installation of any man-portable Heavy weapon such as those on page 57. The user counts as a stable firing rest, and the weapon has two integral magazines of ammo, though it can be loaded by hand as well. The specific weapon mounted can be swapped during maintenance."
Viper Sting,25000,Body,Medical,0.5,Hidden drug injection system,"A tool of assassins, a Viper Sting is a fang, fingernail needle, palm injector, or more exotic implement for injecting an unsuspecting target with a drug of the user's choice. A Viper Sting can be loaded with up to four doses of pharmaceuticals, dispensed as the user wishes. If loaded with a toxin, it does 1d12 damage with a 1d10/x3 Trauma Die. If a tranquilizer is used, the damage is the same, but unconsciousness will result instead of death. A Viper Sting can only be effectively used as part of an Execution Attack, as an alert opponent can avoid it easily. This cyber inflicts a -2 penalty on any check to detect its presence."
Courier Memory,10000,Head,Medical,0.25,Carry locked Memory data,"One unit of cranial Memory is installed with a subdermal upload pad. The person uploading the data can set a passphrase; while the implant user can erase the data, they can't download it again without the passphrase, which is usually told only to the data's intended recipient. Courier memory is exceptionally well-hidden and even medical scans take a -2 penalty to find it."
Cranial Jack,1000,Head,Touch,0.25,Link to jack-equipped gear,A discreetly-placed plug socket in the user's head or neck allows interfacing with cyberdecks and gear equipped with a jack line. 
Discretion Insurance Unit,10000,Head,Medical,0.5,Cranial bomb with remote key,"A small cranial bomb that can be keyed go off when it receives- or does not receive- certain codes or transmissions. Its unfortunate tendency to misfire its anti-removal protocols makes it an unpopular choice for use in anyone but the most disposable subjects. Removing this cyber is done at a +2 difficulty, and failure causes the death of the subject and a Physical save to avoid the death of the physician, with 5d6 damage taken on success."
Eye Mod/Dazzler,15000,Head,Medical,0.5,Dazzle enemies within 5m,"This mod can emit a dazzling strobe of intense light, dazing and disorienting those standing up to five meters in front of the user. The strobe is triggered up to once per round as an On Turn action and adds one System Strain. Victims without eye protection must make a Physical saving throw or take a -4 penalty to their AC and hit rolls for the next 1d6 rounds. A victim can be targeted by this dazzling only once per scene."
Eye Mod/Flechette Launcher,20000,Head,Medical,0.5,Surprise light pistol attack,"A holdout weapon designed for surprise short-ranged attacks, this eye has been loaded with a small explosive flechette. It has the statistics of a light pistol, has a range of 10 meters, and requires a Main Action to reload its single-round magazine. If used against a target in melee range who does not suspect its existence, a normal hit roll is made; on a miss, it does full normal damage anyway, and on a hit, the damage is doubled. It can be used for Execution Attacks."
Funes Complex,40000,Head,Medical,1,Gain eidetic memory,"A synthetic eidetic memory is granted by this implant, with formalized bodies of knowledge easily cross-referenced and recollected. Once per day, as an Instant action, reroll any failed Int-based skill check. This memory can be difficult to control, however, and unwanted allusions can overwhelm the desired datum. If the user rolls a natural 2 on any Int skill check, it automatically fails and cannot be recovered by any rerolling ability."
Medusa Implant,20000,Head,Obvious,0.5,Prehensile hair implants,"These prehensile cranial tendrils take multiple forms, from thick armored cables to bundles of brightly-colored articulated polymer fibers not unlike normal hair. The tendrils are shoulder-length under most circumstances, but can extend to manipulate objects up to three meters distant with the agility of a human hand. The bundles are not very strong, however, and cannot lift more than ten kilograms. Like other extra limbs, they do not grant extra actions, but can hold and use items as any other limb could."
Neural Buffer,40000,Head,Medical,1,Gain 3 HP/level vs hacker dmg,"A system favored by hackers, a Neural Buffer rearranges the user's brain topography, making it more difficult to harm the user with neural feedback. The user gains an additional 3 hit points per level that can only absorb cyberspace damage from Stun or 000ill Verbs. These phantom hit points refresh completely each hour."
Skull Citadel,100000,Head,Medical,2,Armor the brain against harm,"The user's head is augmented with independent blood oxygenation pumps, armor plating, and trauma buffers designed to keep the brain intact even after the rest of the body is critically damaged. Barring dismemberment or the use of high-powered ammunition directly on the target's head, the subject ignores head-affecting Major Injuries and can be stabilized even as long as ten minutes after their technical 'death'. Each such delayed revivification permanently reduces a randomly-chosen attribute by 2 points, however. This ability damage cannot be undone."
Dermal Armor I,40000,Skin,Medical,1,"AC 16, +1 to Trauma Target",Subtle dermal weave reinforcement grants a base ranged and melee AC of 16 and a +1 bonus to the user's Trauma Target. 
Dermal Armor II,80000,Skin,Touch,2,"As I, but AC 18 and Shock resist","Heavier subcutaneous plating acts as Dermal Armor I with a base ranged and melee AC of 18. In addition, the user can ignore the first instance of Shock in a round."
Dermal Armor III,200000,Skin,Sight,3,"As II, but AC 20 and +2 TT","Overt ceramic body plating and double-mesh joint reinforcement acts as Dermal Armor II, but with a base ranged and melee AC of 20 and +2 to the user's Trauma Target."
Poseidon Implants,30000,Skin,Touch,1,Aquatic adaptation mods,"These implants allow the user to function normally while submerged for an indefinite period, drawing any necessary oxygen or drinking water from the surrounding salt or freshwater. Normal temperature extremes are managed without difficulty, and pressure can be handled down to depths of one kilometer. Visual augments and pressure gradient sensors allow the equivalent of normal sight up to 30 meters even in lightless water, and miniaturized support jets allow three-dimensional movement at twice the user's normal Move rating."
Sealed Systems Implant,15000,Skin,Medical,1,Trigger a temp space suit,"When triggered as an Instant action, implanted shields deploy and skinweaves energize to seal the user off from hostile external environments. For the next six hours, the user can operate as if wearing a vacuum suit, ignoring vacuum, contact poisons, non-immediately-lethal levels of radiation, toxic gases, low or high-pressure atmospheres, and environmental temperature hazards short of open flame. After deployment, the implant needs an equal time of recovery before it can be deployed again."
Sharkskin Electrodes,20000,Skin,Touch,1,Shock grapplers,"An implanted mesh of electrodes beneath the user's skin allows them to deliver debilitating shocks while grappling a target, even if both are heavily clothed. At the end of each round of grappling, the user inflicts 2d6 non-lethal electrical damage on anyone they grapple or who is grappling them. The shielding built into the cyber automatically negates non-lethal electrical damage for the user and halves lethal shocks."
Skinmod,250 ,Skin,Sight,0,Make cosmetic-level body mods,"Various neon tattoos, skin texture and color changes, and other superficial physical mods can be performed with no real systemic burden beyond the usual need for regular maintenance."
Skyborn Shielding,40000,Skin,Sight,2,Orbital hab lifestyle mods,"A set of implants and skin treatments meant for those who spend extended periods in hard vacuum, this implant can be triggered as an Instant action. When deployed, the user gains the benefits of a Sealed Systems Implant and low-G microjets that allow 30m/round flight in microgravity conditions. Skyborn Shielding can operate for up to 72 hours before needing an hour of downtime to regenerate."
Body Blades I,10000,Limb,Medical,1,Integral body weaponry,"Assorted retractable blades and spikes are implanted in the user's limbs. Their unarmed attacks do 1d8 damage, Shock of 2/15, Trauma Die 1d8/x3 and can be rolled with either Stab or Punch as the relevant combat skill. The Punch skill does not add damage to Body Blades attacks. When not in use, the blades are perceptible only to a medical scan."
Body Blades II,25000,Limb,Sight,2,Larger body weaponry,"As level one, but the user's body armament includes not only conventional blades, but assorted improvements such as monomolecular edges, cutting vibrations, or thermal augmentation. Their unarmed attacks do 2d6 damage with a Shock of 4/15, and a Trauma Die 1d10/x3. Anyone who sees or touches their arms can detect signs of the cyber, however."
Cyberlimb,10000,Limb,Touch,0.5,Prosthetic with storage space,"A standard medical-grade cyberlimb, albeit one Encumbrance worth of non-weapon equipment or storage can be implanted in each limb and remain Readied without counting against the character's Encumbrance. Add the equipment cost to the limb. The limb provides power to any electronic equipment implanted."
Iron Hand Aegis,40000,Limb,Touch,1,Deflect one ranged hit per scene,"Absorption plates and kinetic ablation units are implanted in the user's arms and linked with a reactive ballistic calculator. Once per scene, as an Instant action, the user can deflect a successful ranged bullet, arrow, or thrown weapon attack, including burst or suppressive fire. Surprise attacks cannot be deflected this way, nor can melee attacks or explosives."
Limbgun,30000,Limb,Touch,1,Implanted gun in a limb,"A ranged weapon is implanted into an arm, tail, or other significant limb, along with space for two magazines worth of ammunition. A full reload of this space can be accomplished as a Main Action. Limbguns can be used with Gunlink cyber, count as Readied at all times, and can be used even while both hands are occupied, but can be bound up in melee as normal guns can. Limbguns have an intrinsic +1 hit bonus, in addition to whatever bonus the implanted weapon may have. The maximum size of the gun is Encumbrance 1 for legs or neolimb tails, or Encumbrance 2 for arms. The buyer must supply the gun. Different guns can be swapped in as desired during the system's monthly maintenance, but once implanted, a gun is useless for later conventional use."
Muscle Fiber Replacement I,50000,Limb,Touch,1,"Str 14, or +2 if higher","Artificial muscle fibers are implanted as replacements for the user's own flesh. The subject gains a Strength score of 14, or +2 if already 14 or higher."
Muscle Fiber Replacement II,200000,Limb,Sight,2,Str 18 and extreme feats,"The subject gains a Strength score of 18, and can smash through standard interior doors or equivalent barriers as a Move action."
Neolimb,25000,Limb,Sight,1,Add a new additional limb,"The user gains an additional limb that normal humans lack. Usual choices involve an additional pair of arms or manipulatory mechano-tentacles, though functional prehensile tails are popular too. One installation of the cyber covers paired limbs or a single tail or body-mounted tendril up to 3 meters long. Neolimbs can support up to one Encumbrance point of non-weaponry built-in tech and add two items to the user's Readied encumbrance allowance. Neolimbs can hold or grip objects, but cannot employ additional shields or grant extra actions."
Omnihand,10000,Limb,Touch,0.25,"Toolkit hand, +1 check 1/scene","A full array of small mechanical and electronic tools are folded into this cybernetic hand. The user is never without the tools for relevant skill checks, and once per day as an Instant action can gain +1 on any skill check involving the omnihand's tool use. As an improvised weapon, the tools do damage as a knife."
Shock Fists,10000,Limb,Touch,1,Do electric fist damage,"The user's hands are implanted with subdermal electrical webbing. As an Instant action, accept one System Strain; for the rest of the scene, the user's unarmed attacks do an additional 1d8 electrical damage on a successful hit. Unarmed attacks augmented with this mod are non-lethal if desired. This system does not stack with Body Blades."
Stick Pads,15000,Limb,Touch,0.5,Climb sheer or vertical surfaces,"Macroscale van der Waals generators allow the user's hands and feet to stick to vertical or overhanging surfaces, their full weight supported by one arm. They can climb such surfaces at their full movement rate with one free hand."
Synthlimb,25000,Limb,Medical,0.5,Lifelike artificial limb,A high-grade cyberlimb that's indistinguishable from an organic body part by anything short of a medical examination. It functions as a Cyberlimb for purposes of implanted equipment. 
Active Sense Processor,50000,Sensory,Medical,1,Gain +1 Wis mod for senses,"Augmented sensory processing grants a +1 Wisdom modifier for all skill checks involving sensing or noticing things, up to a +2 modifier maximum."
Cyberears (pair),10000,Sensory,Touch,0.25,Noise-filtering synthetic ears,"While normal in appearance, touch reveals the synthetic nature of these ears. Some owners prefer to style them in fanciful or unnatural ways. While the base model provides only normal human hearing, all are equipped with ear protection against loud noises. A pair of cyberears or synthears halves the System Strain cost of ear implants."
Cybereyes (pair),10000,Sensory,Sight,0.25,Flash-protected synthetic eyes,"While a single cybernetic eye can be implanted, it is recommended that both be replaced at the same time to improve neural adaptation. These cybereyes are clearly artificial, though most are styled in attractive or striking fashions. They all have perfect 20/20 vision and integral flash protectors, but additional functionality must be implanted separately. A user with a pair of cybereyes or syntheyes halves the System Strain cost of cybernetic eye implants."
Ear Mod/Filter,10000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,Get +2 on hearing skill checks,"The user's sense of hearing is sharpened remarkably, allowing them to follow individual conversations in a noisy crowd, eavesdrop on whispers up to twenty meters distant, and gain a +2 bonus on all hearing-related Notice checks."
Ear Mod/Positional Detection,15000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,Map all sound positions nearby,"This ear mod constructs a spatial map of significant surrounding sounds, allowing the user to know the exact location of anything making audible noise. The precise location of distant shooters, the location of targets in visual concealment, and the positions of moving creatures in darkness are all clear."
Ear Mod/Sonar,20000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,Sense surrounds as if visually,"The user can navigate even in darkness or while blinded by means of ultrasonic sensors, being able to construct a crude map of people and obstacles in front of them out to 20 meters. This sense is the equivalent of vision, though it can't discern details more subtle than faces."
Ear Mod/Tracer,10000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,Eavesdrop on specific targets,"As an On Turn action, the user can nominate a target within 20 meters. Until they get more than 100 meters away from the user or pass behind a solid barrier, the implant's hyper-specific hearing can track their motions perfectly and overhear anything they say or that is said to them. The user can listen to one such target at a time."
Eye Mod/Impostor,10000,Sensory,Medical,1,Mimic retinal patterns,"Aside from allowing free alteration of eye color, this mod allows the user to copy another person's retinal patterns. Provided they are within two meters, they need only meet the user's gaze for a few moments to get a good imprint. The eye can store up to a dozen imprints, but it takes a Main Action to shift from one to another. Note that it is a relatively simple procedure to alter a person's retinal pattern, so an important target alerted to the imposture may end up changing their imprint."
Eye Mod/Infrared Vision,5000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,See heat patterns in the area,"The infrared vision this mod allows permits basic navigation in dark areas and makes the presence of heat sources such as humans, engines, and infrared tripwires very obvious. The user gains a +1 bonus on any Notice checks to detect the presence of thermally-unshielded living creatures."
Eye Mod/Low Light Vision,5000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,See in low-light conditions,"This mod grants low-light vision, allowing clear sight to normal distances in any light condition better than pitch blackness."
Eye Mod/Tactical View,10000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,"Get transmission, search better","These eyes can receive text or video transmissions and play them on an inset in the user's normal vision. Outline and pattern discrimination is enhanced; when specifically looking for things or keeping watch, gain a +1 bonus to any relevant Notice check."
Eye Mod/Zoom,10000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,500m telescopic vision,The user's vision can zoom in on distant targets. The user can see objects within 500 meters as if they were standing next to them. The hit penalty for a ranged weapon's long range is eliminated. 
Gunlink,25000,Sensory,Touch,1,Bonus when using firearms,"Hardwired control points interface with the onboard targeting systems of most modern firearms. When using a modern firearm, the PC ignores range penalties and negates up to 4 points of hit penalties for cover, concealment, or prone targets. Once per scene, as an Instant action, they can reroll a missed attack roll with a gun."
Headcomm,1000,Sensory,Medical,0.25,Silent radio or phone comms,"An implanted phone/short-range radio that can directly communicate within 100 meters or use the phone grid, if it's available. For cranial security reasons, only text and voice can be transmitted, but conversations can be held without audible vocalization."
Sensory Recorder,10000,Sensory,Medical,0.5,Record 3 hours of sense input,"The user can record up to 180 minutes of sensory input. If they have a jack line into a transmitter or cyberware capable of transmitting data, they can share these recordings in real time or afterwards."
Synthears (pair),25000,Sensory,Medical,0.25,Lifelike artificial ears,"This model of artificial ear is designed to be indistinguishable from normal ears, though they have all the properties of a normal pair of cyberears."
Syntheyes (pair),25000,Sensory,Medical,0.25,Lifelike artificial eyes,These high-end cybereyes are designed to be indistinguishable from normal eyes under anything short of a medical examination. Any additional mods made to the eyes share this subtlety. 
Prosthetic Cyber I,5000,None,Sight,1,Mitigates a Major Injury,"One of an array of minimally-adequate and very obvious organ replacements, eye prosthetics, neural patches, and other medical cyber. Prosthetic cyber grants no benefits over ordinary flesh, but can mitigate a Major Injury as explained on page 41. Patients who've lost an arm or leg don't need this cyber; they need a serviceable new limb system such as a Cyberlimb or Synthlimb."
Prosthetic Cyber II,15000,None,Medical,0.25,Mitigates a Major Injury,"A more sophisticated and expensive version of basic prosthetic cyber, inobvious to anything but a medical scan and far less burdensome on the user's system."
Regulated Anagathic Substrate,200000,None,Medical,1,Prolongs human lifespan,"This whole-body network of chem regulators can prolong human lifespans by up to 1d4+2 decades. Maintenance on this cyber costs $50,000 a month, however, and interruptions have catastrophic consequences. Rumors persist of even more effective models existing among the megacorp ultra-elite."
Coordination Augment I,50000,Nerve,Medical,2,"Dex 14, or +2 if higher","The user's natural mindbody interface is tightened. The subject gains a Dexterity score of 14, or +2 if already 14 or higher."
Coordination Augment II,200000,Nerve,Touch,3,Dex 18 and +10m Move,"As Coordination Augment I, but the subject gains a Dexterity score of 18, and their base Move rate is increased by 10 meters."
Enhanced Reflexes I,100000,Nerve,Medical,2,"1/scene, bonus Main Action","Neural acceleration matrices can be deployed to briefly boost the user's reaction speed. Once per scene, as an On Turn action, the user gets a bonus non-cyberspace Main Action."
Enhanced Reflexes II,250000,Nerve,Medical,3,"1/scene, bonus Main and Move","Once per scene, as an On Turn action, the user gains a bonus non-cyberspace Main Action and Move action. By accepting one System Strain, this ability can be used as an Instant action, potentially interrupting incoming attacks if the user moves out of reach."
Enhanced Reflexes III,750000,Nerve,Touch,4,"2/scene, bonus Main and Move","Twice per scene, as an On Turn action up to once per round, the user gains a bonus non-cyberspace Main Action and bonus Move Action. By accepting one System Strain, this ability can be used as an Instant action."
Reaction Booster I,50000,Nerve,Medical,1,+2 Init and Snap Attack benefits,"These implants grant a +2 bonus to your Initiative, perhaps making you act before the rest of your team. Once per scene, as an Instant action, ignore Snap Attack hit penalties."
Reaction Booster II,100000,Nerve,Medical,2,Automatically win initiative,"As level one, but the user automatically wins initiative against targets that don't also automatically win initiative; if both have this ability, initiative is rolled without modifications. The user can act normally during surprise rounds."
Remote Control Unit,10000,Nerve,Touch,2,Remote control drones/vehicles,"A neurally-integrated control link allows for near-range control of drones or remote-rigged vehicles, as per page 81."
Skillplug Jack I,10000,Head,Touch,0.25,Use level-1 intellectual plugs,"A discreet head-mounted plug port allows use of an intellectual skillplug for a skill requiring minimal physical ability, up to level-1. Once slotted, a skillplug takes fifteen minutes to boot up and integrate properly."
Skillplug Jack II,25000,Head,Touch,0.5,Use level-1 plugs of any kind,"This improved plug jack allows use of either an intellectual skillplug or one requiring physical expertise, up to level-1."
Skillplug Wiring,50000,Nerve,Medical,1,Boost skillplug max to level-3,"A neural wiring connection improves a skillplug jack's limits to allow up to level-3 skill usage. One set of wires can support any number of jacks, but at least one is needed."
Trajectory Optimization Node,50000,Nerve,Medical,1,1/scene turn a miss into a hit,"This cyber can calculate the optimal path for bypassing defenses and striking a target. Once per scene, as an Instant action, turn a missed hit roll into a success. Melee and unarmed attacks can be used as-is, but using this unit with a ranged attack requires an active Gunlink with the weapon."
Zombie Wires,60000,Nerve,Medical,2,Keep acting at zero HP,"Functioning only for a user with at least one Body cybersystem to serve as a motor substrate, 'zombie wires' allow a user to keep functioning even at zero hit points. As an Instant action at zero hit points, the user can give their body a one-sentence command involving physical action. Their insensate flesh will blindly carry out that action for up to six rounds until it is complete or they take up to one quarter of their maximum hit points in further damage, which will kill them instantly. Time spent under Zombie Wires counts against a user's stabilization time limit. Triggering this cyber adds 2 System Strain."
