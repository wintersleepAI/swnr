Ablative Code Buffer,0.1,1,drone,Numerous self-correcting back- up circuits are wired in to delay any hostile hack- ing intrusions. The drone automatically succeeds on the first opposed skill check made against a hostile hacker in a given scene.
Altitude Boost Unit,0.1,1,drone,"Most flying drones have an effective ceiling of 1,000 meters if there are no scramblers to lessen the effective control range. This unit increases a flying drone`s maximum altitude to 5,000 meters, making most effectively invisible to ordinary sight. Such height does, however, make it extremely conspicuous to aerial scanners used by city law enforcement and high-security corp buildings. The speed of their response will depend on the drone`s apparent threat."
Ammo Caddy,0.1,1,drone,"A specialized form of cargo space, this drone is able to carry and dispense substantial amounts of ammunition to adjacent allies. It can hold up to 6 fully-loaded magazines in quick-release clips that can be grabbed as On Turn actions by an ally. The clips remain locked for strangers. This fitting can be taken up to once per two points of the drone`s Encumbrance, rounded up."
Ammo Supply,0.1,1,drone,"An automated ammo feeder is added to the drone. Two full magazines are added to one mounted weapon`s allotment, or one magazine to two weapons. This fitting can be added more than once."
Assisted Boost Burner,0.1,1,drone,"The drone is equipped with reactive chemical booster that can be ignited to give it a very brief burst of tremendous speed. When activated as a Move action, the burner launches the drone up to 500 meters in a straight line. The boost is not precise enough to use as an aimed weapon, but solid obstacles in front of the drone will suffer half the drone`s HP in damage and inflict all of theirs on the drone. The burner functions only once before it require a scene to regenerate its charge."
Cargo Space,0.2,1,drone,"Most drones are designed to carry only their own weight. This fitting upgrades engines and adds cargo mounts to the drone`s exterior; it can carry up to 3 points of Encumbrance now, but the drone`s own Encumbrance value is increased by one. Any additional cargo it carries is added to this burden, of course. Carried cargo is sealed within the drone and requires a Main Action to dig out."
Command Deck/Follow,0.1,1,drone,"The drone is equipped with minimal autonomous pursuit capabilities. As a Main Action, the drone can be ordered to follow a particular visible target at a given distance at either half or full speed. If half speed, it will use its Move action to follow, and full speed will use both Move and Main Actions. Following can be ended as an On Turn command."
Command Deck/Kill,0.25,1,drone,"The drone has autonomous attack routines wired into it. As a Main Action, it can be ordered to kill one specific visible target. If the target is in range of its weapons, it will use its Main Action to attack; if no additional fittings are added, its autonomous attacks have a total hit bonus of +2. The drone will not automatically move to follow or engage its target or otherwise position itself tactically unless directly piloted to do so or operating under the Follow command."
Command Deck/Patrol,0.1,1,drone,"As a Main Action, the drone can be ordered to autonomously move to one or more waypoints on whatever schedule the pilot wishes. The drone can also be ordered to loiter at a particular location until it gets an On Turn command to proceed to the next location."
Command Deck/Watch,0.1,1,drone,"The drone is equipped to monitor its surroundings autonomously and alert its pilot when something of interest is noticed. Its onboard intelligence is limited, however, and it can only handle about a sentence`s worth of specific orders or subjects to be watchful for. Putting a drone in Watch mode is a command that takes a Main Action."
Emergency Evac Litter,0.25,1,drone,"Functioning only for groundbased drones of Enc 3 or greater, the drone is equipped with a retractable litter that can fit one human patient, along with manipulators sufficient to get a prone victim onto the litter with a Main Action. Onboard meds allow for remote Heal skill checks to stabilize a Mortally Wounded target, with one attempt allowed as part of the loading action. A loaded patient can`t be harmed until the drone is destroyed or opens the litter, but if the drone dies, the patient does too. As a Main Action, the drone can be ordered to autonomously take the patient to a particular location. As an On Turn action, an onboard transmitter can also place a call for medical assistance to a pre-arranged number."
Emissions Shielding,0.2,1,drone,"The drone is designed to minimize its electromagnetic emissions and thermal signature. Skill checks to spot it with such sensor suffer a -2 penalty."
Enhanced Structure,0.25,1,drone,"The drone`s maximum hit points increase by 25% of its unmodified base, rounded up. As with Improved Armor, this fitting is ineffective on drones that aren`t man-portable."
Extended Range,0.25,1,drone,"The drone can now operate for two hours on a full battery charge."
Glider Grips,0.2,1,drone,"Usable only by flying drones of Enc 3 size or greater, this fitting allows a human-sized mass to use the drone as a form of parachute-glider. As a Main Action, a user can leap off a high place after grabbing the drone and descend safely to the ground at a distance as far from the initial point as that point was above the ground. Similar weights can be sent safely to the ground in the same way."
Improved Armor,0.25,1,drone,"The drone`s AC improves by 2, to a maximum of 18, but its Encumbrance rating increases by one. This fitting is ineffective on drones too big to have an Encumbrance rating; they need vehicle-grade armor upgrades."
Improved Targeting Logic,0.2,1,drone,This unit allows a skilled drone pilot to tweak the combat logic of its onboard weaponry. The drone`s attack gains a hit bonus equal to the pilot`s Drive or Program skill level when firing autonomously; no bonus is given if the pilot is in direct control.
Laser Comms,0.1,1,drone,"This fitting provides both a set of universal transceiver plug-ins and a laser comm hub for the drone. Provided the PCs are in line of sight of the drone, normal radio-wave based comms can be switched to lasers, providing uncrackable, electromagnetically-inaudible communications within the group. Radio comms can still be used as needed."
Manipulator Tendrils,0.2,1,drone,"One set of manipulators is added to the drone, whether a mechanical claw, an articulated metal tendril, or some other device. With a Main Action command from the pilot, it can function as a single human hand with an effective Strength of 12, but it cannot effectively be used for an attack or to lift anything heavier than the drone itself. The fitting can carry things for short distances, but to haul weight any real distance the Cargo Space fitting is required. This fitting can be added more than once if a pair of `hands` are needed."
Memory Banks,0.1,1,drone,"The drone has two units of cyberdeck Memory added to it. While this Memory can be used to store hacker programs or datafiles, it also has room to record up to a week of audiovisual data per unit used. This fitting can be added more than once."
No Touch Web,0.1,1,drone,"Most commonly installed on small ground drones, this web can be armed as a Main Action by the pilot. Until disarmed, any attempt to grab or pick up the drone automatically inflicts 2d6 non-lethal electrical damage on the grabber. This shock continues each round as long as the drone is held, with up to 5 discharges total before the battery must be recharged. The firm contact required makes it impractical to use the web as an offensive weapon."
Sleep Mode,0.1,1,drone,"Sleep mode can be enabled with a Main Action command or ended with an On Turn command. While in sleep mode, a drone cannot fly, move, or perform actions, but it will continue to communicate with the pilot and observe its surroundings. A day of sleep mode counts as ten minutes of ordinary operation for battery drain purposes."
Stealth Package,0.25,1,drone,"Usable only on drones of Enc 3 or smaller, this fitting adds color-changing drone sheathing, noise damping, and thermal sealing to the unit. It gains an effective Sneak-1 skill when operating autonomously, or a +2 bonus to Sneak checks when being directly piloted."
Suicide Charge,0.25,1,drone,"With a Main Action command to detonate, the drone will explode, doing 3d6 damage to anyone within ten meters, with an Evasion save for half. Subjects behind solid cover further halve the damage. Drones reduced to zero hit points are too badly damaged to respond to detonation commands."
Telescopic Optics,0.2,1,drone,The drone can focus on objects up to one kilometer away with a visual acuity sufficient to read a newspaper. Integral low-light sensors allow it to see in all but total darkness.
Thermal Optics,0.2,1,drone,"The drone is equipped with IR optics that can see heat patterns. The drone can function adequately even in complete darkness and grants the pilot a +1 bonus to Notice skill checks where thermal imaging might be useful."
Trauma Response Suite,0.25,1,drone,"An array of injectors, scalpels, sutures, and trauma chems are built into the drone, allowing it to function as a medkit and make Heal skill checks for a medically-competent pilot or an on-site doc in need of a kit. Such medical efforts require a Main Action from the pilot as usual, and flying drones apply a -2 penalty to the skill check due to their innate instability. Up to six pharmaceutical doses of the pilot`s choice can be loaded into the drone."
Voice Broadcast,0.1,1,drone,The pilot can speak through the drone or cause it to emit other noises at a volume loud enough to be heard clearly a hundred meters away.
Wallcrawler,0.2,1,drone,"Usable only on ground-based drones of Enc 3 or less, this fitting allows the drone to climb sheer surfaces at its normal movement rate, assuming the surface is sturdy enough to bear its weight. Most high-security buildings are constructed with veneers that defeat this fitting, but ordinary structures seldom have such measures."
Weapon Hardpoint,0.25,1,drone,"Drones that are not factory-equipped with weapon hardpoints can have one worked in as an aftermarket addition. The usual hardpoint limits on maximum allowed weapon size still apply, however, and this fitting counts as two for purposes of the drone`s maximum fittings."
