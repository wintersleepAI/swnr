    Instapanel: In its compressed form, an instapanel is a two-kilo cube of
    ceraplast five centimeters on a side. When a type A power cell is inserted
    in the cubeâ€™s side, it immediately expands to an opaque, waterproof
    ceraplast sheet 2 meters on each side and a centimeter thick. Five minutes
    later the ceraplast hardens into a tough, rigid shape, but until then it can
    be folded or bent by hand. Instapanels can be bonded to one another with a
    metatool or a toolkit. Breaking an instapanel requires inflicting at least
    twelve points of damage on it.
