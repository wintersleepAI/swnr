    Navcomp: A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers, astronomic
    charts, and gyroscopes packed into a flat, one-kilo case. A character with a
    navcomp will never get lost on worlds with GPS satellites. They can also
    make a crude but serviceable automatic map of all buildings or landscapes
    they travel through. Other terrestrial navigation skill checks are made at a
    +1 bonus.
