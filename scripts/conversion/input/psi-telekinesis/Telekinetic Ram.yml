    <p>As a Main Action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to target a
    tremendous, uncontrolled burst of force at a single target within sight.
    This burst requires some time to detonate, however, and will only go off at
    the end of the next round. Targets of this technique are aware of an
    oppressive, electrical tingling in the air and are apt to instinctively
    move; this technique is thus generally useless against any target that is
    not entirely immobile, as any movement of a chosen target disrupts the ram.
    Once the ram detonates, however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile
    civilian vehicle, create a five-meter hole in anything short of hardened
    military fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else as if it
    were struck by a Heavy weapon.</p>
