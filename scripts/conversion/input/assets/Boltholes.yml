  description: >-
    Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make cleaning them out a costly
    and dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the
    same planet as the Boltholes suffers damage sufficient to destroy it, it is instead
    set at 0 HP and rendered untouchable and unusable until it is repaired to full
    strength. If the Boltholes are destroyed before this happens, the asset is destroyed
    with them.
