    Deployed to confuse enemy factions into untimely investments. As an action, the
    marketers may test Cunning vs. Wealth against a rival faction's asset. If successful,
    the target faction must immediately pay half the asset's purchase cost, rounded
    down, or have it become disabled and useless until this price is paid.
