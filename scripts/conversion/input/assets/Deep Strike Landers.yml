  description: >-
    These advanced transport ships are capable of moving an asset long distances.
    As an action, any one non-Starship asset, including itself, can be moved between
    any two worlds within three hexes of the deep strike landers, at a cost of 2 FacCreds.
    This movement can be done even if the local planetary government objects, albeit
    doing so is usually an act of open war.
