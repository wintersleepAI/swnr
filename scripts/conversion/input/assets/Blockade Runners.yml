    These starship captains excel at transporting goods through unfriendly lines.
    As an action, a blockade runner can transfer itself or any one Military Unit or
    Special Forces to a world within three hexes for a cost of two FacCreds. They
    can even move units that would otherwise require planetary government permission
    to enter.
