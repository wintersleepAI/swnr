  description: >-
    Headshot pods are a family of guided missiles meant for mounted deployment on
    vehicles or large drones. They always target AC 10 to hit, but require two full
    consecutive rounds of aiming at a visible target to get a target lock on them
    and prime for firing on the third round. Any bystanders within 5 meters of the
    impact take damage as if from a frag grenade. A headshot pod missile costs $2,000.
