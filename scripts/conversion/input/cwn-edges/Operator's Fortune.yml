    You may or may not be good, but you are undeniably lucky. Once per game session
    as an Instant action, when something bad happens to you such as an injury, a failed
    save, or a botched skill check, test your luck and roll 1d6. On a 1, the bad event
    is unaffected. On a 2-5, you somehow avert the consequences by blind chance. On
    a 6, it actually lands on an enemy or rival of the GM's choice, if that's possible.
    Only events that happened in this same round can be averted.
