    You may begin play with up to $200,000 worth of new or secondhand cyber. If secondhand,
    you roll once per system for its defect and may end up with unusable junk. You
    don't need to pay for installation and its maintenance is covered for the next
    two months. You can redeem this Edge later in your career by paying double the
    cost of the cyber you selected; if so, you can trade this Edge in for a different
    one with the GM's approval. See page 27 for example packages of cyber you might
    pick to suit your character's concept.
