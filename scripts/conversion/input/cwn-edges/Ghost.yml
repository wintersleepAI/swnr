    You are uncannily elusive. Gain Sneak as a bonus skill and the Fighting Withdrawal
    combat action is an On Turn action for you. Once per scene, reroll a failed Sneak
    check related to sneaking or going unseen. Once per game day, as a Move action,
    move up to 10 meters without anyone around you seeing you move. If you use this
    movement to get behind cover, you might seem to vanish outright to onlookers.
