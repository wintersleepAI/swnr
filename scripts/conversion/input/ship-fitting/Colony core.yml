  description: >-
    The ship has been designed to act as the core of a future settlement.
    Once this fitting is engaged, the ship ceases to be operational as a
    starship, and builds out into a set of habitats, hydroponic gardens,
    fusion plants, and living spaces sufficient to support up to five times
    its maximum crew, including enough fabrication and workshop facilities
    to keep the settlement operational under normal conditions. The settlement
    can be a deep-space hab, orbital installation, or planetary settlement.
    In the latter case, the ship must land to form the settlement; even ships
    without atmospheric configuration can do so, but they can never take off
    again. Once activated, a colony core can not be re-packed.
  effect: Ship can be deconstructed into a colony base
