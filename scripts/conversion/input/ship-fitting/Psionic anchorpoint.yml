  description: >-
    This pretech relic is unavailable on the open market in most sectors.
    Once installed in a ship, it can be "imprinted" by up to a dozen psychics.
    These psychics can sense and affect any object or location within ten meters
    of the relic after one minute of concentration, provided they are within
    the same solar system. Thus, teleporters can always teleport next to the
    anchorpoint, telepaths can always contact anyone within the affected zone,
    telekinetics can manipulate objects near the relic, and so forth. The relic
    can be re-coded to eliminate existing imprints, but any psychic wo gets access
    to the relic for ten minutes of meditation and focus can imprint on it
    afterwards. There is no obvious way to tell how many psychics have
    imprinted to the anchorpoint.
  effect: Focal point for allied psychics' powers
