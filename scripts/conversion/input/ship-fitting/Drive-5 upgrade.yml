    A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1 spike drive
    with additional phase filters and power throughput refinements.
    A captain needs to buy only the final grade of drive desired.
    He does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives of rating 4
    and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that cannot be built
    on most modern worlds.
  effect: Upgrade a spike drive to drive-5 rating
