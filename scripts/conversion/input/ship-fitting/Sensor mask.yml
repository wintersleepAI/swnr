  description: >-
    The ship can disguise its long-range sensor readings, spoofing scans
    with the ID tags and apparent hull type of any other ship of its choice.
    To penetrate this masquerade, the scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program
    skill check against difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking
    ship's comms officer. Once the ship is close enough to visually identify,
    the masking is useless.
