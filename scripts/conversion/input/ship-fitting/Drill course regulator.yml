  description: >-
    Drills along a known spike drive route have no chance of failure
    so long as the route is no longer than twice the operating pilot's
    skill level and does not onvolve course trimming. Thus, a navigator
    with Pilot-1 skill would always succeed in making a drill of two hexes
    or less, provided the route was a known one. The drill course regulator
    requires a siphisticated technical base and compatible metadimensional
    energy conditions in a given sector; many sectors no longer have this
    technology or lack the right environment to use it. If the GM prefers
    a campaign where space travel is always at least somewhat dangerous,
    they may deny access to this fitting. Ships piloted by exceptionally
    talented navigators may choose not to mount it even the.
  effect: Common drill routes become auto-successes
