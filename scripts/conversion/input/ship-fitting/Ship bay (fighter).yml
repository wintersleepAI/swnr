  description: >-
    These sophisticated docking bays provide all the necessary tools
    and support for launching a starship from the mother craft. They are
    rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers, but some
    cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay
    allows room for one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the carried
    ship can support its own crew if necessary, most carriers fold their space
    wing into the mothership's crew roster. This fitting can be taken
    multiple times.
