    An extremely rare example of psitech dating from before the Scream,
    a precognitive nav chamber allows a character with at least Precognition-2
    psionic skill to assist in interstellar drills, sensing impending shear
    alterations before they happen. The navigator automatically succeeds
    on any spike drill check of difficulty 9 or less. On a failed check,
    add 2 to the Spike Drive Mishap roll, limiting the potential damage.
    On drilling in to the destination system, the psychic has expended
    all Effort in the process.
