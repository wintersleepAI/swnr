  description: >-
    Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate objects
    within its immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding
    objects no larger than a ship of one hull class smaller.
    Targets with ship-scale propulsion can resist the beams,
    but lifeboats, individual suit jets, or other smaller
    propulsors are inadequate. The beam can focus only on one
    Object at a time but can move it into the ship's cargo bays
    or hurl it out of the ship's immediate vicinity within three
    rounds. The beams can only effectively manipulate objects in
    very low gravity, and not those on the surface of planets or
    other objects with significant natural gravity.
