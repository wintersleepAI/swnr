  description: >-
    Carefully-designed storage space intended to conceal illicit cargo
    from customs inspection. Each installation of this fitting adds 200
    kilograms of cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons in a frigate, 20 tons
    in a cruiser, or 200 tons in a capital ship. Cargo in smuggler's hold
    will never be found by a standard customs inspection. Careful investigation
    by a suspicious official can find it on a difficulty 10 check using their
    Wis/Notice skill, and a week-long search one step short of disassembly
    will find it on a difficulty 7 check.
  effect: Small amount of well-hidden cargo space
