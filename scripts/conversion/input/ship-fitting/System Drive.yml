  description: >-
    The shipâ€™s standard drive-1 spike drive is
    removed and replaced with a different propulsion
    system. The ship is still treated as having a drive-1
    for maneuvering and system transit purposes, but
    it cannot make interstellar drills. This modification 
    lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and
    adds extra power and space based on the size of
    the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2 for frigates, 3 for
    cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this
    amount of free mass is gained by the process.
  effect: Replace spike drive with small system drive
