    On-board workshops can be bought at smaller than maximum sizes than a hull
    would allow, if additional TL4 tech facilities aren't strictly needed.
    A frigate-sized workshop is sufficient for modding any personal gear as per
    the modification rules on page 90. A cruiser-sized workshop handles
    vehicle modding and starship maintenance, and a capital-class workshop
    can build vehicles or similar large work from scratch at full cost.
