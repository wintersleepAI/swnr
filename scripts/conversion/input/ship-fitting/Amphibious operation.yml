  description: >-
    This fitting includes the benefits of the Atmospheric Configuration
    fitting, as well as allowing the ship to operate while immersed
    in a liquid medium. Submerged ships cannot be detected with
    conventional planetary traffic sensors and require military
    sonar and naval sensors to fix their position, resources often
    unavailable on less developed worlds. So long as the ship stays
    away from military naval craft and bases, is is almost
    impossible to track while submerged. Only fighter and frigate
    hull classes can mount this fitting.
