  description: >-
    Automated mining and refinery equipment has been built into the ship,
    allowing it to extract resources from asteroids and planetary surfaces.
    Careful extraction of specific lodes of valuable minerals can be quite
    profitable at the GM's discretion, but if the crew is simply melting down
    available asteroids for raw materials, the unit can refine one ton of
    usable materials per day worth about 500 credits in most markets. These
    raw materials can be used to feed a mobile factory, and a ship may have
    more than one mobile extractor fitted to it to multiple the return
    if sufficient raw feedstock is available. Operating an extractor
    requires at least five crew members.
