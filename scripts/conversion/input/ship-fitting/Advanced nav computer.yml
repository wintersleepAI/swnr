    Forging new spike courses is too much an art to rely on
    computerized assistance, but an advanced nav computer
    can help on well-mapped routes. When navigating an
    interstellar drill course with charts less than a year old,
    the navigator decreases drill difficulty by 2.
  effect: Adds +2 for traveling familiar spike courses
