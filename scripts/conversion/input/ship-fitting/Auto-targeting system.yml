  description: >-
    Some ships run with more guns than crewmen. A single NPC
    or PC can man one gun per round, firing it as often as
    gunnery chief's Fire One Weapon or Fire All Guns actions allow,
    but sometimes that's not enough. Installing an automatic targeting
    system for a gun allows it to shoot at a +2 hit bonus without
    human assistance. This system must be installed once for each gun
    that is to be self-manned.
  effect: Fires one weapon system without a gunner
