    This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was
    uncommon even on Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen
    people or 1200 kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from
    the surface of a planet or the interior of another ship, provided
    it is no more than a few tens of thousands of kilometers distant.
    Ship-to-ship teleportation is possible only when the receiving ship
    is cooperating by transmitting accurate coordinate details;
    otherwise, a friendly unjammed signal from inside is necessary to lock
    onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are possible
    only in the absence of physical barriers between the ship and the
    target point below. The teleporters may be used once every five minutes.
    In those rare sectors where this tech is widely available, it costs 200k.
