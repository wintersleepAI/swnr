    Selecting this fitting equips the ship with a number of single-use
    escape craft capable of reaching the nearest habitable planet or station
    in a star system. If no such destination exists, the boats can maintain
    their passengers for a year in drugged semi-stasis. Lifeboats have
    fully-functional comms systems and are usually equipped with basic
    survival supplies and distress beacons. A single selection of this
    fitting provides enough lifeboats for a ship's maximum crew,
    with up to twenty people per boat.
