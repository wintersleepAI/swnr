    Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment,
    a captain can simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped
    have whatever amounts of TL4 military-grade weaponry and armor
    that a crew might require, and integral maintenance facilities
    for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to outfit
    the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use
    may deplete it.
