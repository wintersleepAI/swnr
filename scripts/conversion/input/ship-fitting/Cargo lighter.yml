  description: >-
    Cruisers and larger craft can't land on planetary bodies,
    so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter
    is only capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly
    twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to a standard pressurized
    cargo container holding up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers.
    These containers are usually collapsible and take up no significant
    space when compressed for storage, assuming they're not simply
    disposable cargo shells. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
