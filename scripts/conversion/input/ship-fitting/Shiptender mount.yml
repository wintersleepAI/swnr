  description: >-
    The ship is designed with symbiosis mounts that allow other ships
    to "hitch" on the crat's spike drills. Each shiptender mount allows
    one craft of a hull size smaller than the tender to link up for intersystem
    drills. Mounts cannot be used for in-system travel. If the linking ship
    has been designed to be carried by a tender then establishing this link
    takes one hour. If not, it takes a full day to fit the ship into the mount.
    Ships can dismount from the tender with an hour's disentanglement. In an
    emergency, the carried ship can dismount instnatly, but the mountings are
    considered disable then until repairs are made. Carried ships cannot fight.
  effect: Allow another ship to hitch on a spike drive
