  description: >-
    The ship has been carefully fitted to support the use
    of non-sentient expert system robots in its operation.
    At least one human, VI, or True AI crew member is necessary
    to oversee the bots and monitor spike drills, but otherwise
    crew may be replaced with cheap, basic robots at a cost of 1000
    credits per crew member replaced. Bots don't draw any pay,
    don't take up life support, and their maintenance is assumed
    to be part of the ship's operating costs. These bots are
    incapable of any actions unrelated to operating the ship
    and are treated as level-0 in their skills where relevant.
  effect: Ship can use simple robots as crew
