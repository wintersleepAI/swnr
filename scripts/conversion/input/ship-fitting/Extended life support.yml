    The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew
    or passengers. Extended life support can be fitted multiple times;
    each time, the maximum crew rating of the ship increases by 100%
    of its normal maximum. Thus, a free merchant who installs this
    twice can have a maximum complement of 18 people.
