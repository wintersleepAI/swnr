  description: >-
    Free mas can be traded for pressurized cargo space. Tracked by weight
    for convenience, one cubic meter is usually one ton, with most vehicles
    requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks taking 25, and aircraft or mechs
    taking up 50 tons of cargo space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons
    of cargo space in a fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200 tons in a cruiser
    and 2000 tons in a capital-class ship. This fitting can be purchased
    multiple times.
