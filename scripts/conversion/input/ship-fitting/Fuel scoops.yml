  description: >-
    Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction of hydrogen
    from gas giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction
    process requires four days of processing and refinement, but completely
    refuels the ship. Such fittings are common on explorer craft that
    cannot expect to find refueling stations.
  effect: Ship can scoop fuel from a gas giant or star
