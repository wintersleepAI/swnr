  description: >-
    The ship is equipped with a full-scale TL4 fabrication plant programmed
    to support its needs. The ship can stock raw materials and parts at 5000
    credits per ton; these parts can then be used to "pay" ship repair or maintenance
    costs when conventional shipyards are unavailable. The factory can also create
    repair vehicles, TL4 equipment, space habs, and planetary structures with these
    parts at a rate of 10000 credits worth of construction a day. If a mobile extractor
    is available, the raw materials processed by the latter unit can be used to feed
    the factory. Operating a mobile factory requires at least 100 well-trained
    personnel. Each 10 fewer doubles repair or maintenance times.
