    These drones are invariably short-lived due to enormous
    energy signatures they produce, but until the ship's
    next turn they grant a +2 AC bonus as their emissions
    confuse foes. Foxer drones are cheaply constructed
    and essentially free; the only limit on their number
    is the amount of free space set aside for holding them.
  effect: +2 AC for one round when fired
