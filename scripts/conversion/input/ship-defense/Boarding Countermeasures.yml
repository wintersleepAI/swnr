  description: >-
    The ship has hardened bulkheads, reinforced hatches, and specially-designed
    automated kill corridors for wiping out intruders. Provided that the ship's
    bridge is still under control, the operator can prevent entry to the ship
    by any force that lacks shipyard-grade tools, weapons capable of melting hull
    plating, or specialized military breaching implements. If intruders do get inside,
    only well-equipped, specially-trained marines have any real chance of breaching
    the defences. Ordinary space pirates or more casual invaders have only a 1 in 6
    chance of threatening the bridge crew, though they may cause significant damage
    in their dying.
