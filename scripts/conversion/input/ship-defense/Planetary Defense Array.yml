  description: >-
    The ship is equipped with an array of gravitic braker guns and
    an upgraded nuke snuffer field. While useless in conventional
    ship-to-ship combat, the array can deflect or dampen meteor impacts,
    dropped penetrator rods, or other non-powered bombardment techniques,
    and the snuffer field is powerful enough to prevent nuclear fission
    reactions over a hemisphere-sized area. A single ship with a PDA can
    protect against any natural meteor strikes and deny easy terror
    bombardment of a planet's population. The PDA cannot fully protect
    against orbital strike by powered penetrators, but it can nudge them
    off course and make pinpoint strikes impractical. Most developed planets
    have much more powerful and effective ground installations, but a
    PDA-equipped ship is a useful emergency stopgarp for poor or primitive worlds.
