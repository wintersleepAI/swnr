  description: >-
    A high-powered secondary ECM generator can be activated
    to negate any one otherwise-successful hit against the ship.
    This generator can be activated after the damage has been
    rolled, but enemy ships rapidly compensate for the new ECM
    source, and so the generator can only be used effectively
    once per engagement.
  effect: Negate one successful hit
