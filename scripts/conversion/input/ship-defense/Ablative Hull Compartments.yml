    By sacrificing empty hull space in a complex system
    of ablative blast baffles, a capital-class ship can
    have a large amount of its mass shot away without
    actually impinging on its normal function. This grants
    it a +1 AC bonus and 20 extra maximum hit points.
  effect: +1 AC and +20 maximum hit points
