  description: >-
    The Icarus harness is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a
    conventional parachute with a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to
    fall an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3 meters drains a
    type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30
    minutes per vacc refresh.
