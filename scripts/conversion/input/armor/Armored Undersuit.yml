  description: >-
    An armored undersuit is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced TL4 fibers
    with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact dispersion
    capabilities. Transparent panels allow for it to be worn with almost any
    outfit without drawing notice or being detected without a close tactile
    examination.
