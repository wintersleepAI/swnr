    You’re remarkably gifted at making friends and forging ties with the people
    around you. Wherever you go, you always seem to know somebody useful to your
    ends.
  level1: >-
    Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you’ve spent at least a week in a
    not-entirely-hostile location, you’ll have built a web of contacts willing
    to do favors for you that are no more than mildly illegal. You can call on
    one favor per game day and the GM decides how far they’ll go for you.
  level2: >-
    Once per game session, if it’s not entirely implausible, you meet someone
    you know who is willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when and
    where you want to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are and what
    they can do for you.
