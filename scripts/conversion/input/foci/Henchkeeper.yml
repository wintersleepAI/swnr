  description: >-
    You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do your
    bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement,
    sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A
    henchman obtained with this focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly
    betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important”
    people in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the
    desperate, or other persons with few options. You can use more conventional
    pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings
    are no more loyal or competent than your pay and treatment can purchase.
  level1: >-
    Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within 24 hours of
    arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These
    henchmen will not fight except to save their own lives, but will escort you
    on adventures and risk great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be
    treated as Peaceful Humans from the Xenobestiary section of the book. You
    can have one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have,
    rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible
    time and pick them back up later should you be without a current henchman.
  level2: >-
    Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you
    against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural
    competence or their devotion to you, they’re treated as Martial Humans from
    the Xenobestiary section. You can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and
    highly-capable NPCs, but this requires that you actually have done them some
    favor or help that would reasonably earn such fierce loyalty.
