    Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road, theyâ€™ve mastered a
    number of tricks for ensuring their mobility and surviving the inevitable
    difficulties of a vagabond existence.
  level1: >-
    Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey basic ideas in all the common
    languages of the sector. You can always find free transport to a desired
    destination for yourself and a small group of your friends provided any
    traffic goes to the place. Finding this transport takes no more than an
    hour, but it may not be a strictly legitimate means of travel and may
    require working passage.
  level2: >-
    You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers and identification for the
    party with 1d6 hoursof work. These papers and permits will stand up to
    ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/Administer versus Wis/Notice
    check if examined by an official while the PC is actually wanted by the
    state for some crime. When finding transport for the party, the
    transportation always makes the trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter
    would.
