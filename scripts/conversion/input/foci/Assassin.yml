data:
  description: >-
    You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in carrying
    out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on page 52.
  level1: >-
    Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no larger than a
    knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including
    normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can draw or produce this object as
    an On Turn action, and your point-blank ranged attacks made from surprise
    with it cannot miss the target.
  level2: >-
    You can take a Move action on the same round as you make an Execution
    Attack, closing rapidly with a target before you attack. You may split this
    Move action when making an Execution Attack, taking part of it before you
    murder your target and part of it afterwards. This movement happens too
    quickly to alert a victim or to be hindered by bodyguards, barring an actual
    physical wall of meat between you and your prey.
