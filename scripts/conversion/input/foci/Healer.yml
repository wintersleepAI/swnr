    the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades.
  level1: >-
    Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one
    mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When
    rollingHeal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
  level2: >-
    Stims or other technological healing devices applied by you heal twice as
    many hit points as normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you can heal
    1d6+Heal skill hit points of damage to every injured or wounded person in
    your group with ten minutes of first aid spread among them. Such healing can
    be applied to a given target only once per day.
