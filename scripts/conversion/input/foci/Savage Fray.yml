  description: >-
    You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can survive being
    surrounded far better than most combatants.
  level1: >-
    Gain Stab as a bonus skill. All enemies adjacent to you at the end of your
    turn whom you have not attacked suffer the Shock damage of your weapon if
    their Armor Class is not too high to be affected.
  level2: >-
    After suffering your first melee hit in a round, any further melee attacks
    from other assailants automatically miss you. If the attacker who hits you
    has multiple attacks, they may attempt all of them, but other foes around
    you simply miss.
