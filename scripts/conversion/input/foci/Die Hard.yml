  description: >-
    You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under
    stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.
  level1: >-
    You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per level. This bonus applies
    retroactively if you take this focus after first level. You automatically
    stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than a Heavy weapon.
  level2: >-
    The first time each day that you are reduced to zero hit points by an
    injury, you instead survive with one hit point remaining. This ability canâ€™t
    save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.
