    You have a tremendous natural talent for ship combat, and can make any
    starship you captain a significantly more fearsome opponent. You must take
    the captainâ€™s role during a fight as described on page 117 of the Ship
    Combat rules in order to benefit from this focus.
  level1: >-
    Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Your ship gains 2 extra Command Points at the
    start of each turn.
  level2: >-
    A ship you captain gains bonus hit points equal to 20% of its maximum at the
    start of each combat. Damage is taken from these bonus points first, and
    they vanish at the end of the fight and do not require repairs to replenish
    before the next. In addition, once per engagement, you may resolve a Crisis
    as an Instant action by explaining how your leadership resolves the problem.
