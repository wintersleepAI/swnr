    You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to
    slugthrowers or energy weapons, it is also applicable to thrown weapons,
    bows, or other ranged weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For
    thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same
    time as Gunslinger.
  level1: >-
    Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can draw or holster a Stowed ranged weapon
    as an On Turn action. You may add your Shoot skill level to a ranged
    weapon’s damage roll.
  level2: >-
    Once per round you can reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action if it
    takes no more than one round to reload. Even on a miss with a Shoot attack,
    you do an unmodified 1d4 damage.
