    You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike
    drills. While most experienced pilots can manage conventional drills along
    well-charted spike routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths
    and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.
  level1: >-
    Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically succeed at all spike
    drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.
  level2: >-
    Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks. Spike
    drives of ships you navigate are treated as one level higher; thus, a
    drive-1 is treated as a drive-2, up to a maximum of drive-7. Spike drills
    you personally oversee take only half the time they would otherwise require.
