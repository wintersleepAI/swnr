    Gain Stab as a bonus skill. You can draw or sheath a Stowed melee or thrown
    weapon as an Instant action. You may add your Stab skill level to a melee or
    thrown weapon’s damage roll or Shock damage, assuming it has any to begin
    with.

    unmodified 1d4 damage to the target, plus any Shock damage. This bonus
    damage doesn’t apply to thrown weapons or attacks that use the Punch skill.
