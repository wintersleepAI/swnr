    Squeal (Heal-1): This “truth serum” is unreliable but still one of the best
    available options for field interrogations. The subject must be immobilized
    or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards they will be
    unable to avoid answering questions about facts known to them; they will be
    unable to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a judgment, but they
    will answer specific questions about facts known to them truthfully.
    Unwilling victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on a success, they
    can simply refuse to speak about one particular topic of their choice.
    Targets pass out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are immune to it
    for a week thereafter.
