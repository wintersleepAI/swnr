  description: >-
    These implants allow the user to function normally while submerged for an indefinite
    period, drawing any necessary oxygen or drinking water from the surrounding salt
    or freshwater. Normal temperature extremes are managed without difficulty, and
    pressure can be handled down to depths of one kilometer. Visual augments and pressure
    gradient sensors allow the equivalent of normal sight up to 30 meters even in
    lightless water, and miniaturized support jets allow three-dimensional movement
    at twice the user's normal Move rating.
