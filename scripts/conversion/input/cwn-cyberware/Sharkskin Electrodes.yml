  description: >-
    An implanted mesh of electrodes beneath the user's skin allows them to deliver
    debilitating shocks while grappling a target, even if both are heavily clothed.
    At the end of each round of grappling, the user inflicts 2d6 non-lethal electrical
    damage on anyone they grapple or who is grappling them. The shielding built into
    the cyber automatically negates non-lethal electrical damage for the user and
    halves lethal shocks.
