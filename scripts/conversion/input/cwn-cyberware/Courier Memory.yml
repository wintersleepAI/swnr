    One unit of cranial Memory is installed with a subdermal upload pad. The person
    uploading the data can set a passphrase; while the implant user can erase the
    data, they can't download it again without the passphrase, which is usually told
    only to the data's intended recipient. Courier memory is exceptionally well-hidden
    and even medical scans take a -2 penalty to find it.
