  description: >-
    As an On Turn action, the user can nominate a target within 20 meters. Until they
    get more than 100 meters away from the user or pass behind a solid barrier, the
    implant's hyper-specific hearing can track their motions perfectly and overhear
    anything they say or that is said to them. The user can listen to one such target
    at a time.
