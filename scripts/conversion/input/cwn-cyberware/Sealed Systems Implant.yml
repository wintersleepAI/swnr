  description: >-
    When triggered as an Instant action, implanted shields deploy and skinweaves energize
    to seal the user off from hostile external environments. For the next six hours,
    the user can operate as if wearing a vacuum suit, ignoring vacuum, contact poisons,
    non-immediately-lethal levels of radiation, toxic gases, low or high-pressure
    atmospheres, and environmental temperature hazards short of open flame. After
    deployment, the implant needs an equal time of recovery before it can be deployed
    again.
  effect: Trigger a temp space suit
