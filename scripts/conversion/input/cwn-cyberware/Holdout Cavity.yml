  description: >-
    A biosculpted torso pocket allows for the air-tight, climate-controlled concealment
    of 2 Encumbrance worth of items inside the user's body and their easy access with
    a Main Action. Any given object stored can't be larger than a pistol or a tightly-folded
    suit of clothing, and the pocket's contents don't count against the user's Encumbrance
    limit. The pocket's signature is disguised against conventional scanning technology,
    and it cannot be detected without a manual strip search by a trained examiner.
  effect: 2 Enc. of hidden body space
