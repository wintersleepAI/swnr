    A set of customized medical and therapeutic implants are used to control the side-effects
    of a partially-successful cyberware implant. For each implantation of this system,
    the user can choose to ignore one implant side-effect they currently suffer. The
    skill check to implant this system can fail, but it never induces any side effects
    on its own.
  effect: Suppress an implant side-effect
