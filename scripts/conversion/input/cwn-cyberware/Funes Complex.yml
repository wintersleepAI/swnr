  description: >-
    A synthetic eidetic memory is granted by this implant, with formalized bodies
    of knowledge easily cross-referenced and recollected. Once per day, as an Instant
    action, reroll any failed Int-based skill check. This memory can be difficult
    to control, however, and unwanted allusions can overwhelm the desired datum. If
    the user rolls a natural 2 on any Int skill check, it automatically fails and
    cannot be recovered by any rerolling ability.
  effect: Gain eidetic memory
