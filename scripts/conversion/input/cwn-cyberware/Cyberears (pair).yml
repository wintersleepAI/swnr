  description: >-
    While normal in appearance, touch reveals the synthetic nature of these ears.
    Some owners prefer to style them in fanciful or unnatural ways. While the base
    model provides only normal human hearing, all are equipped with ear protection
    against loud noises. A pair of cyberears or synthears halves the System Strain
    cost of ear implants.
