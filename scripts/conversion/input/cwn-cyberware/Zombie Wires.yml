    Functioning only for a user with at least one Body cybersystem to serve as a motor
    substrate, 'zombie wires' allow a user to keep functioning even at zero hit points.
    As an Instant action at zero hit points, the user can give their body a one-sentence
    command involving physical action. Their insensate flesh will blindly carry out
    that action for up to six rounds until it is complete or they take up to one quarter
    of their maximum hit points in further damage, which will kill them instantly.
    Time spent under Zombie Wires counts against a user's stabilization time limit.
    Triggering this cyber adds 2 System Strain.
  effect: Keep acting at zero HP
