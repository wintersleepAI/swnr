  description: >-
    The user's head is augmented with independent blood oxygenation pumps, armor plating,
    and trauma buffers designed to keep the brain intact even after the rest of the
    body is critically damaged. Barring dismemberment or the use of high-powered ammunition
    directly on the target's head, the subject ignores head-affecting Major Injuries
    and can be stabilized even as long as ten minutes after their technical 'death'.
    Each such delayed revivification permanently reduces a randomly-chosen attribute
    by 2 points, however. This ability damage cannot be undone.
  effect: Armor the brain against harm
