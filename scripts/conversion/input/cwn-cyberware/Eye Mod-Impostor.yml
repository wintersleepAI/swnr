    Aside from allowing free alteration of eye color, this mod allows the user to
    copy another person's retinal patterns. Provided they are within two meters, they
    need only meet the user's gaze for a few moments to get a good imprint. The eye
    can store up to a dozen imprints, but it takes a Main Action to shift from one
    to another. Note that it is a relatively simple procedure to alter a person's
    retinal pattern, so an important target alerted to the imposture may end up changing
    their imprint.
