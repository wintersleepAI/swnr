    While a single cybernetic eye can be implanted, it is recommended that both be
    replaced at the same time to improve neural adaptation. These cybereyes are clearly
    artificial, though most are styled in attractive or striking fashions. They all
    have perfect 20/20 vision and integral flash protectors, but additional functionality
    must be implanted separately. A user with a pair of cybereyes or syntheyes halves
    the System Strain cost of cybernetic eye implants.
  effect: Flash-protected synthetic eyes
