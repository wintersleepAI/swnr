  description: "A set of standardized support implants provide a baseline degree of\
    \ cyber-compatibility to a subject. They can ignore System Strain from cyber implants\
    \ equal to 12 minus their Constitution score- so a PC with a Constitution of 9\
    \ could ignore three points worth of System Strain from cyber implants. PCs with\
    \ a Con of 12 or more have no use for this system. "
