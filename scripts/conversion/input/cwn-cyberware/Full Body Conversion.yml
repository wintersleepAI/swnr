  description: >-
    The user's brain and central nervous system are transplanted into a cutting-edge
    synthetic shell at a cost and difficulty as if this cyber took 4 System Strain.
    Once converted, the subject has an effective Constitution of 20 for System Strain
    purpose, but cannot be healed by conventional first aid or medical drugs, requiring
    ten minutes of repair work with a toolkit to repair any amount of damage, and
    $250 worth of parts for each hit point to be restored. A full conversion borg
    no longer requires food, water, air, or sleep, but each day without the latter
    adds one System Strain due to the mental stress. The conversion requires twelve
    hours of maintenance every two weeks, and missing it will result in the user's
    death in 2d6 days unless the omitted maintenance is performed. Current full-body
    conversion tech is unstable; after 1d4 years, the subject has a cumulative 5%
    death chance each year. Borgs do not take Major Injuries and gain a +6 bonus to
    their Trauma Target that stacks with existing bonuses.
