  description: >-
    Numerous small projectile launchers are embedded under synthetic skin. When triggered
    as an On Turn action, the user gains one System Strain to launch a cloud of shrapnel
    around them, acting as ground zero of a frag grenade explosion. The user has enough
    targeting control to avoid hitting allies in range. If grappling or grappled at
    the time, their opponent automatically takes maximum damage. Reloading the Retribution
    Shield takes five minutes, and the system will not function if the user is wearing
    suit-grade armor. Lesser armor can usually be tailored to expose adequate amounts
    of skin.
  effect: Burst to harm melee targets
