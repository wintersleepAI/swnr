    A wide-spectrum array of blood scrubbers, intake filters, and microbial barriers
    grants the user effective immunity to most natural diseases and non-synthetic
    toxins. Weaponized toxins and certain exotic natural afflictions can still affect
    the user, but they get a +2 bonus on all saving throws against them. The system
    automatically alerts the user if they have been exposed to a recognized disease
    or toxin, whether or not it affects them.
