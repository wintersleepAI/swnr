    A gritty powder trafficked to those addicts too poor to afford anything better,
    a snorted dose of Sand will put its user into a euphoric haze for as long as an
    hour, depending on tolerance. Beautiful visions and dreamy contentment give way
    to shooting pains and intense light sensitivity afterwards, with most heavy users
    dying within six to twelve months of picking up the habit.
