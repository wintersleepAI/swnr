    A rare drug of desperation, Reset is a combination injector patch and wireless
    cyber override key. When applied to a willing subject with at least one Body or
    Nerve cyber system, it deluges the user's system with safety override commands
    and neurotransmitter stimulants. They lose all accumulated System Strain in excess
    of their permanent minimum. Five minutes later, their System Strain is maximized
    and they must make a Physical saving throw at a penalty equal to the number of
    System Strain they've gained since the drug was taken. On a success, they drop
    to 1 hit point. On a failure, they become Mortally Wounded. If their adjusted
    roll is 1 or less, they must make a second modified Physical save or instantly
    and unavoidably die. Using Reset more than once a week is invariably fatal.
