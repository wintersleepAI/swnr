    A chem that briefly induces severe swelling of the mucous membranes, Chokeout
    is odorless and tasteless, but must be consumed in food or drink and naturally
    degrades after twelve hours. A subject who consumes a dose of Chokeout must make
    a Physical save; on a failure, they are strangled to unconsciousness for an hour,
    waking up with one hit point at the end. On a success, they take 1d10 non-lethal
    damage as they struggle to breathe. On a natural saving throw of 1, the victim
    chokes to death.
