    One of a thousand different medical drugs, a prescription like this is often necessary
    to treat some chronic condition or keep a medical problem from growing worse.
    Corp employees get their drugs for a pittance, but less fortunate souls need to
    source their drugs from extortionate corp pharmacies or street docs. Lucky users
    only need a dose a few times a week, but others must have a daily supply or suffer
    potentially lethal complications.
