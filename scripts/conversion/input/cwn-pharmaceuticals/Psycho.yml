    Ingesting one of these small pills rapidly flattens a user's capacity for emotional
    distress while heavily increasing their aggressiveness. For roughly one hour,
    users gain a +2 bonus to Morale checks and experience no immediate emotional trauma
    from performing even the most heinous and violent actions. The drug is a favorite
    pre-fight dose among gangers, and used as self-medication among many of them who
    would otherwise be incapacitated by the emotional scars of what they've done.
