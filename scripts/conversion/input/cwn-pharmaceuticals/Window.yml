    (Heal-1) A neurobooster favored among hackers and knowledge workers, Window augments
    the user's focus and mental reaction speed at the cost of distracting them from
    their terrestrial surroundings. A Window user can trade their Move action to gain
    a bonus Main Action that can only be used for cyberspace actions. Each time this
    is done in a scene, however, the user gains one System Strain. One dose lasts
    for one scene.
