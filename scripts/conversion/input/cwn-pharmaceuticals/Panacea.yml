    (Heal-1) Not so much a single drug as a pharmaceutical suite in a single injection
    system, this chem requires a skilled physician to adjust its mix. When used as
    part of a first aid attempt, this drug doubles the amount of hit points recovered
    by the attempt, with a minimum healing rate of 6 HP. Rumors of a drastically increased
    rate of bone cancers among regular users are, of course, mere slander against
    its manufacturer.
