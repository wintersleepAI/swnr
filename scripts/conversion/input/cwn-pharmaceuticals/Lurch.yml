    (Heal-0) An emergency stimulant meant to shock a downed ally back into mobility,
    Lurch heals 1d10 damage plus the physician's Heal skill on application, adding
    one System Strain to the target. Each dose of Lurch after the first each day increases
    the required Heal skill by one, so the third dose requires Heal-2 to successfully
    administer. Lurch only works on conscious and stabilized targets; the shock will
    kill a Mortally Wounded subject that hasn't been made stable.
