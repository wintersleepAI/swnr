    A chem that intensely stimulates a subject's memory centers, Madeleine has its
    dangers. Users normally focus on a particular memory before injecting the drug;
    for the next 1d6 hours, they relive some portion of that memory with perfect fidelity
    while remaining oblivious to their physical surroundings. Psychological addiction
    is a considerable risk for long-term users, as well as choosing a less pleasant
    memory to recall.
