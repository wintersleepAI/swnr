    A filthy mix of jailbroken corp industrial chems and amphetamine scrapings, Boneshaker
    is a popular combat drug among the most impoverished or savage street gangs. On
    application, the subject is filled with blind aggression, gaining a +2 Morale
    bonus and a +2 bonus to hit rolls, damage, and Shock. The recklessness induced
    by Boneshaker leaves them wide open, however, and all attacks against them add
    +2 to any Trauma Die rolls. Boneshaker lasts for one scene and adds 2 System Strain
    at the end of it.
