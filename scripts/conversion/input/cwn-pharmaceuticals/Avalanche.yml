    (Heal-0) A somewhat pricey combat drug favored by shock troops and those first
    out of the trenches, Avalanche numbs sensations of pain or exhaustion for one
    hour, granting the user an effective +10 to their current hit points, even if
    it takes them above their maximum. This numbness tends to make it harder to notice
    serious harms, however, and the d12 roll for any Major Injury suffered while under
    its effects takes a -1 penalty.
