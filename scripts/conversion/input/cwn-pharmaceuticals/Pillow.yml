    (Heal-0) A powerful sedative that requires medical expertise to administer properly,
    Pillow must be injected into a restrained or helpless subject, as vigorous physical
    action can disrupt the effects. Once injected, the subject falls into a torpor
    indistinguishable from death that lasts for 24 hours. They require only trace
    amounts of oxygen while in their trance, and can be identified as alive only through
    careful medical examination. If Pillow is administered with less than a 24-hour
    gap between doses, the victim must make a Physical save or die sometime before
    the dose ends.
