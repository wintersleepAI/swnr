    A watery black toxin that must be administered through food or direct injection,
    Hellbender causes the victim to convulse with bone-cracking force shortly after
    consumption. A dose of Hellbender has a distinct acrid taste, but if the victim
    consumes it they must make a Physical saving throw or begin convulsing helplessly
    for 1d6 rounds, suffering 1d10 damage each round unless restrained by at least
    two associates. This damage can kill an unfortunate victim.
