    (Heal-0) A 'respectable' combat chem used by certain units of corporate security,
    Olympus numbs pain, sharpens mental focus, and slows down instinctive panic or
    rush instincts, allowing a calm observation of the battlefield. Users can reroll
    their first failed Morale check in a fight and gain a +2 bonus to hit rolls. One
    dose of Olympus lasts for one scene, and adds one System Strain at its end.
