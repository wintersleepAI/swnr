  description: >-
    The driver can order the vehicle directly or by radio or phone to go to
    particular places at particular times or perform other simple, direct
    actions on a given schedule. The onboard expert system can handle
    traffic-related challenges, but has no real intelligence to process more
    complicated problems.
