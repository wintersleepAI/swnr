  description: >-
    An entire second vehicle can be mounted with this fitting, Medium vehicles
    taking Small parasites and Large ones taking Small or Medium. Adding a mount
    for a Small vehicle takes up 3 Mass while a Medium one takes 6. Modifying a
    vehicle to be mounted adds 10% to its base cost, but it can be launched even
    while the parent vehicle is underway. These parasite vehicles are destroyed
    if the parent is; otherwise, they take only half the damage the parent
    takes.
