  description: >-
    The drone is loaded with sophisticated self-piloting software. It can be
    given a flight plan by its operator, have targets designated for its weapon,
    and respond to simple environmental cues. Each new command takes up a Main
    Action and commands with any conditional states may require an Int/Program
    skill check to get the drone to understand. The drone can fire only one
    weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of +2 if attacking
    autonomously. Quantum ECM will scramble this lightweight system.
