system:
  description: The drone is loaded with sophisticated self-piloting software. It can be given a flight plan by its operator, have targets designated for its weapon, and respond to simple environmental cues. Each new command takes up a Main Action and commands with any conditional states may require an Int/Program skill check to get the drone to understand. The drone can fire only one weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of +2 if attacking autonomously. Quantum ECM will scramble this lightweight system.
