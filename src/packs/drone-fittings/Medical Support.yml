  description: The drone can be loaded with up to a dozen units of medication, whether stim doses, lazarus patches, or less benevolent substances. It can launch a medication through a remote injector at a target within ten meters in lieu of a weapon attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while hostiles require a normal hit roll. The drone is treated as having Heal-0 skill or the active pilotâ€™s Heal skill, whichever is higher.
