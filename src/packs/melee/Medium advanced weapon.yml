  description: Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other obvious implements of war. While they can’t be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when the wielder needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters. An advanced one has been given a monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a chainsaw blade, or some other TL4 touch. Advanced weapons can ignore primitive plate and hide protections.
