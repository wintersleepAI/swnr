  description: >-
    Unarmed attacks reflect ordinary kicks and punches. Unarmed attacks always
    add the attackerâ€™s Punch skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons.
    Kinesis wraps, spiked knuckles, and other small fist weapons may be treated
    as small advanced or primitive weapons that use the Punch skill and add the
    skill level to their rolled damage, but not to Shock. Such weapons do not
    augment a hero with the Unarmed Combatant focus.
