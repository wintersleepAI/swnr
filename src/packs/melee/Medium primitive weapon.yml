  description: Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other obvious implements of war. While they can’t be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when the wielder needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters. A primitive weapon is simply one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech augmentations. Primitive weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered armor.
