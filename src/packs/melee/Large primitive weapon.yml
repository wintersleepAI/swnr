  description: Large weapons are two-handed implements of bodily ruin such as claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count as two encumbrance items. A primitive weapon is simply one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech augmentations. Primitive weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered armor.
