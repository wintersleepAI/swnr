  description: Large weapons are two-handed implements of bodily ruin such as claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count as two encumbrance items. An advanced one has been given a monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a chainsaw blade, or some other TL4 touch. Advanced weapons can ignore primitive plate and hide protections.
