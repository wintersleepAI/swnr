  description: A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to anything short of a medical examination. Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs five times as much grants even more protection, rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive weapons as if they were wearing powered armor.
