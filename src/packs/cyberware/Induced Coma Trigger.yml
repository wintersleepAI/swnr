  description: 'A series of implants are wired to the userâ€™s brain stem, allowing them to trigger an induced therapeutic coma at a mental command. The user appears dead to anything short of a medical inspection, and has no need of respiration, food, or water while the coma is in effect. The user does not heal while in a coma, but any diseases or poisons also halt progression. The user determines how long the coma is to last before triggering it, and is unconscious for its duration. A character can survive in a coma up to two weeks before needing to regain consciousness for as long as they were in the coma.    '
