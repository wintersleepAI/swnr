  description: Occasionally purchased by workers in hard vacuum or other hostile environments, pressure sheathing integrates an ultrathin pressure membrane with the user’s dermis and emergency film sealants that trigger at the user’s mental command. The pressure sheathing serves as an emergency vacc suit with an integral oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can sustain them for up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath needs 48 hours to regain structural integrity and power after triggering. A pressure sheath can be detected only by a close medical examination.
