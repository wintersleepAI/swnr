  description: 'Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user when activated while exciting the userâ€™s perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold, dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty on all social skill checks while the unit is active, and it requires five rounds to toggle it.'
