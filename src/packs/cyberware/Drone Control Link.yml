  description: Most often found among military bot wranglers, civilians can also get a drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting of drones and other robotic units. Users of a link can issue commands to a drone as a Move action instead of a Main Action. A single drone can only receive one command per round, however. Aside from this ease of command, someone with an implanted rig can "look" through a piloted drone's sensors as an Instant action, and a drone is never considered to be out of control even if the pilot doesn't spend an action controlling it. A link can maintain a connection with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program skill.
