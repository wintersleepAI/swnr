    These additional synthetic organs and filters allow the bearer to survive in
    thin-atmosphere conditions, as well as tolerate temperatures ranging from
    Antarctic chill to heat sufficient to boil water. They can also eat a wide
    range of native life forms for sustenance; no normal planetâ€™s native biology
    is ever considered immiscible for consumption.
