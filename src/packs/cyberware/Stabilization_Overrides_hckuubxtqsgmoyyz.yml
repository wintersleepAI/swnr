  description: >-
    An intricate interweaving of microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted
    in the subject’s torso and spinal column. These overrides can stabilize the
    user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced
    to 0 hit points is automatically stabilized, as if a Lazarus patch had been
    successfully applied to them, assuming that a patch could have saved them.
    Stabilization overrides tend to interfere with the ordinary operation of the
    user’s organs, however, and the wearer’s Constitution modifier is lowered by
    1, with all the attendant consequences in loss of maximum hit points.
