  description: 'Tsunami (Heal-1): An emergency combat stim used to juice certain expendable soldiers before an assault, Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short effect duration and difficult application limits its wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score of 12, 10 extra hit points for ten minutes and a +2 bonus on all hit rolls. At the end of the duration, they immediately lose those 10 hit points, which may leave them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to the target.'
