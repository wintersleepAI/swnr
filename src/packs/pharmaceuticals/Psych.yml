  description: 'Psych (None): A military drug duplicated in rougher form by many street chemists, Psych fills the user with an intense sense of confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their judgment regarding danger. A person affected by Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the user, and is highly psychologically addictive.'
