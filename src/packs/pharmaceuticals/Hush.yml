  description: 'Hush (Heal-0): An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer, Hush leaves the subject awake and responsive to simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight or communicate while affected by Hush, but will walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects.'
