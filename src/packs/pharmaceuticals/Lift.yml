  description: 'Lift (Heal-0): A Lift stim augments and amplifies the body’s natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user’s Heal skill in hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them, though application to a stabilized target will get them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each additional application of Lift to a target the same day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1.'
