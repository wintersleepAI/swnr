  description: 'Tightbeam link unit: Much like a remote link unit, a tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via lineof-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit, thereâ€™s almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this link, but it requires that the infiltrators get a clear line of sight between the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed for skyward aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.'
