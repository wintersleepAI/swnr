system:
  description: Numerous small projectile launchers are embedded under synthetic skin. When triggered as an On Turn action, the user gains one System Strain to launch a cloud of shrapnel around them, acting as ground zero of a frag grenade explosion. The user has enough targeting control to avoid hitting allies in range. If grappling or grappled at the time, their opponent automatically takes maximum damage. Reloading the Retribution Shield takes five minutes, and the system will not function if the user is wearing suit-grade armor. Lesser armor can usually be tailored to expose adequate amounts of skin.
