  description: An implanted mesh of electrodes beneath the user's skin allows them to deliver debilitating shocks while grappling a target, even if both are heavily clothed. At the end of each round of grappling, the user inflicts 2d6 non-lethal electrical damage on anyone they grapple or who is grappling them. The shielding built into the cyber automatically negates non-lethal electrical damage for the user and halves lethal shocks.
