  description: >-
    An implanted mesh of electrodes beneath the user's skin allows them to
    deliver debilitating shocks while grappling a target, even if both are
    heavily clothed. At the end of each round of grappling, the user inflicts
    2d6 non-lethal electrical damage on anyone they grapple or who is grappling
    them. The shielding built into the cyber automatically negates non-lethal
    electrical damage for the user and halves lethal shocks.
