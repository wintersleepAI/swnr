  description: One of an array of minimally-adequate and very obvious organ replacements, eye prosthetics, neural patches, and other medical cyber. Prosthetic cyber grants no benefits over ordinary flesh, but can mitigate a Major Injury as explained on page 41. Patients who've lost an arm or leg don't need this cyber; they need a serviceable new limb system such as a Cyberlimb or Synthlimb.
