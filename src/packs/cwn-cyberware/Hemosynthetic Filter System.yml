  description: A wide-spectrum array of blood scrubbers, intake filters, and microbial barriers grants the user effective immunity to most natural diseases and non-synthetic toxins. Weaponized toxins and certain exotic natural afflictions can still affect the user, but they get a +2 bonus on all saving throws against them. The system automatically alerts the user if they have been exposed to a recognized disease or toxin, whether or not it affects them.
