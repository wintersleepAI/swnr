  description: >-
    When triggered as an Instant action, implanted shields deploy and skinweaves
    energize to seal the user off from hostile external environments. For the
    next six hours, the user can operate as if wearing a vacuum suit, ignoring
    vacuum, contact poisons, non-immediately-lethal levels of radiation, toxic
    gases, low or high-pressure atmospheres, and environmental temperature
    hazards short of open flame. After deployment, the implant needs an equal
    time of recovery before it can be deployed again.
