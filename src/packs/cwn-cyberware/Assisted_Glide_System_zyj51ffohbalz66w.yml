  description: >-
    Retractable nanofiber wings and integral boost jets allow a limited degree
    of flight for the user of this implant. When leaping from a high place, they
    gain a flight Move speed of 30m for up to two kilometers before being forced
    to land. Gaining altitude requires a Dex/ Exert skill check against
    difficulty 10, however, with failure forcing a landing, and the wings can't
    carry them more than twice as high as the height they jumped from. By
    deploying the boost jets and wings as an Instant action, the user can ignore
    up to a hundred meters of falling damage.
