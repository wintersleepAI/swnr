  description: A holdout weapon designed for surprise short-ranged attacks, this eye has been loaded with a small explosive flechette. It has the statistics of a light pistol, has a range of 10 meters, and requires a Main Action to reload its single-round magazine. If used against a target in melee range who does not suspect its existence, a normal hit roll is made; on a miss, it does full normal damage anyway, and on a hit, the damage is doubled. It can be used for Execution Attacks.
