  description: >-
    A set of standardized support implants provide a baseline degree of
    cyber-compatibility to a subject. They can ignore System Strain from cyber
    implants equal to 12 minus their Constitution score- so a PC with a
    Constitution of 9 could ignore three points worth of System Strain from
    cyber implants. PCs with a Con of 12 or more have no use for this system. 
  effect: Gain Con 12 for cyber purposes
