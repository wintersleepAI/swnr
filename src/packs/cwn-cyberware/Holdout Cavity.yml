  description: A biosculpted torso pocket allows for the air-tight, climate-controlled concealment of 2 Encumbrance worth of items inside the user's body and their easy access with a Main Action. Any given object stored can't be larger than a pistol or a tightly-folded suit of clothing, and the pocket's contents don't count against the user's Encumbrance limit. The pocket's signature is disguised against conventional scanning technology, and it cannot be detected without a manual strip search by a trained examiner.
