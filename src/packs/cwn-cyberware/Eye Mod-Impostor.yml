  description: Aside from allowing free alteration of eye color, this mod allows the user to copy another person's retinal patterns. Provided they are within two meters, they need only meet the user's gaze for a few moments to get a good imprint. The eye can store up to a dozen imprints, but it takes a Main Action to shift from one to another. Note that it is a relatively simple procedure to alter a person's retinal pattern, so an important target alerted to the imposture may end up changing their imprint.
