  description: The user gains an additional limb that normal humans lack. Usual choices involve an additional pair of arms or manipulatory mechano-tentacles, though functional prehensile tails are popular too. One installation of the cyber covers paired limbs or a single tail or body-mounted tendril up to 3 meters long. Neolimbs can support up to one Encumbrance point of non-weaponry built-in tech and add two items to the user's Readied encumbrance allowance. Neolimbs can hold or grip objects, but cannot employ additional shields or grant extra actions.
