  description: 'A set of standardized support implants provide a baseline degree of cyber-compatibility to a subject. They can ignore System Strain from cyber implants equal to 12 minus their Constitution score- so a PC with a Constitution of 9 could ignore three points worth of System Strain from cyber implants. PCs with a Con of 12 or more have no use for this system. '
