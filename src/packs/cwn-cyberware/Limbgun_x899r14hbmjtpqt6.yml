  description: >-
    A ranged weapon is implanted into an arm, tail, or other significant limb,
    along with space for two magazines worth of ammunition. A full reload of
    this space can be accomplished as a Main Action. Limbguns can be used with
    Gunlink cyber, count as Readied at all times, and can be used even while
    both hands are occupied, but can be bound up in melee as normal guns can.
    Limbguns have an intrinsic +1 hit bonus, in addition to whatever bonus the
    implanted weapon may have. The maximum size of the gun is Encumbrance 1 for
    legs or neolimb tails, or Encumbrance 2 for arms. The buyer must supply the
    gun. Different guns can be swapped in as desired during the system's monthly
    maintenance, but once implanted, a gun is useless for later conventional
    use.
