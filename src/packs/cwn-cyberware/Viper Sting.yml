  description: A tool of assassins, a Viper Sting is a fang, fingernail needle, palm injector, or more exotic implement for injecting an unsuspecting target with a drug of the user's choice. A Viper Sting can be loaded with up to four doses of pharmaceuticals, dispensed as the user wishes. If loaded with a toxin, it does 1d12 damage with a 1d10/x3 Trauma Die. If a tranquilizer is used, the damage is the same, but unconsciousness will result instead of death. A Viper Sting can only be effectively used as part of an Execution Attack, as an alert opponent can avoid it easily. This cyber inflicts a -2 penalty on any check to detect its presence.
