  description: >-
    Sniper rifles are often nothing more than bolt-action rifles with expensive
    tuning and optics. If not fired from a rest in a prepared position, a sniper
    rifle's statistics are the same as a normal rifle. This weapon can be
    reloaded with a Move action, or an On Turn if the user has at least Shoot-1
    skill.
