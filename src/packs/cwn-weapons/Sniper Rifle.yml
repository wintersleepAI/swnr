  description: Sniper rifles are often nothing more than bolt-action rifles with expensive tuning and optics. If not fired from a rest in a prepared position, a sniper rifle's statistics are the same as a normal rifle. This weapon can be reloaded with a Move action, or an On Turn if the user has at least Shoot-1 skill.
