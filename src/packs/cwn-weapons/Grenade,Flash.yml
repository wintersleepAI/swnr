  description: Grenades may be thrown at a point within range and always target AC 10. On a miss, the grenade bounces 1d10 meters in a random direction before exploding. Grenades have a 5-meter radius of effect. Flash grenades force victims without eye and ear protection to make a Physical save; on a failure, the victim loses their next Main Action and takes a -2 penalty to hit rolls and AC for the next 1d6 rounds. Flashbang effects don't stack, and a target who makes their save cannot be flashbanged again that same round.
