  description: >-
    Grenade launchers are accessories that are mounted on rifle-sized firearms,
    adding 1 Encumbrance to their bulk. These weapons can launch
    specially-designed grenades to the listed range, targeting them as if they
    were thrown normally. These special grenades cost and function the same as
    their regular equivalents but cannot be thrown by hand. When attacking, the
    user can choose whether to fire the grenade launcher or the weapon it's
    mounted to, but both cannot be fired in the same round.

    Stand-alone grenade launcher models are available for vehicle or drone
    mounting, counting as 2 Encumbrance but otherwise having the same cost and
    statistics.
