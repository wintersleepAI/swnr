  description: Grenades may be thrown at a point within range and always target AC 10. On a miss, the grenade bounces 1d10 meters in a random direction before exploding. Grenades have a 5-meter radius of effect. Gas grenades create a 10-meter-diameter cloud of opaque, choking, irritating gas that disperses in one round. They inflict non-lethal damage, halved on a successful Physical save, and are useless against targets with breathing protection. They provide full concealment for those within the gas. Smoke grenades are harmless, but provide the same 10-meter dome of concealment where it's necessary. Gas and smoke aren't enough to defeat IR or augmented visuals.
