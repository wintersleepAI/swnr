  description: |-
    Grenade launchers are accessories that are mounted on rifle-sized firearms, adding 1 Encumbrance to their bulk. These weapons can launch specially-designed grenades to the listed range, targeting them as if they were thrown normally. These special grenades cost and function the same as their regular equivalents but cannot be thrown by hand. When attacking, the user can choose whether to fire the grenade launcher or the weapon it's mounted to, but both cannot be fired in the same round.
    Stand-alone grenade launcher models are available for vehicle or drone mounting, counting as 2 Encumbrance but otherwise having the same cost and statistics.
