  description: >-
    Rocket launchers include a wide variety of single-shot disposable launchers.
    Their general imprecision forces a -4 hit penalty against human-sized
    targets, but they inflict frag grenade damage on any target within 5 meters
    of the rocket's landing point. Specialized anti-armor warheads lose this
    frag grenade bonus, but do double damage to vehicles or obstacles. Operators
    who intend to take down enemy vehicles favor them for their effectiveness in
    that role. This weapon's Trauma Die can inflict Traumatic Hits on drones,
    vehicles, and other machines.
