  description: >-
    Mortars are rare, but have their uses amid the tall buildings of an urban
    sprawl. They have a minimum range of 20 meters, but can lob indirect fire
    over buildings and obstacles. Mortars always target AC 20 at first, but each
    round of fire at the same target grants a +1 hit bonus if there's a forward
    spotter to adjust the aim. Mortar rounds act as frag grenades on the target
    point, but do 3d6 damage at base with a 10-meter radius. Armor doesn't
    lessen harm from mortar rounds.

    Relatively simple as they are, a mortar round costs $50 and counts as one
    item of encumbrance.
