  description: >-
    Shotguns of various stripes can be found under the counter of practically
    every bar and shop in a slum. Simple double-barrel models can be made by any
    home gunsmith with a pulse, but the finer tolerances and more elaborate
    machining of a burst-fire capable combat shotgun leaves them as a more
    selective product. Ranges and damages given are for shot shells; slugs
    double their normal and extreme ranges but apply a -1 penalty to hit rolls.
