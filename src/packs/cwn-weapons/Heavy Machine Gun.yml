  description: Heavy machine guns are old tech, but reliable. Without a fixed firing position or vehicle mount, however, their recoil makes them almost uncontrollable. Due to the mass of lead involved in firing an HMG, each 'round' of its ammunition costs $100 and counts as a full item of encumbrance. This weapon's Trauma Die can inflict Traumatic Hits on drones, vehicles, and other machines.
