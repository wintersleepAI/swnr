  description: >-
    A holdout weapon designed for surprise short-ranged attacks, this eye has
    been loaded with a small explosive flechette. It has the statistics of a
    light pistol, has a range of 10 meters, and requires a Main Action to reload
    its single-round magazine. If used against a target in melee range who does
    not suspect its existence, a normal hit roll is made; on a miss, it does
    full normal damage anyway, and on a hit, the damage is doubled. It can be
    used for Execution Attacks.
