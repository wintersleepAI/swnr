  description: >-
    Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weapons are available almost
    anywhere on the street. Particularly impoverished gangers sometimes fashion
    makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better can’t be obtained. Such
    weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls
    due to their ungainly make.
