  description: >-
    Grenades may be thrown at a point within range and always target AC 10. On a
    miss, the grenade bounces 1d10 meters in a random direction before
    exploding. Grenades have a 5-meter radius of effect. Gas grenades create a
    10-meter-diameter cloud of opaque, choking, irritating gas that disperses in
    one round. They inflict non-lethal damage, halved on a successful Physical
    save, and are useless against targets with breathing protection. They
    provide full concealment for those within the gas. Smoke grenades are
    harmless, but provide the same 10-meter dome of concealment where it's
    necessary. Gas and smoke aren't enough to defeat IR or augmented visuals.
