  description: >-
    Some men and women are born with a very limited form of MES, the mental
    condition that allows for the use of psychic powers. While these people are
    not true psychics, these “wild talents” can create one limited psychic
    effect. Training is not always required to develop this ability, and their
    MES is so mild that they don’t suffer the risk of madness or brain damage
    that more developed psychics risk should they use their powers without
    proper training. Wild talents are not treated as psychics for general
    purposes and cannot “torch” their powers. When relevant, they are treated as
    having one point of Effort. Psychics and Partial Psychics cannot take this
    focus.<br><br>Level 1: Pick a psychic discipline. You gain an ability
    equivalent to the level-0 core power of that discipline. Optionally, you may
    instead pick a level-1 technique from that discipline, but that technique
    must stand alone; you can’t pick one that augments another technique or core
    ability. For example, you could pick the Telekinetic Armory technique from
    Telekinesis, because that ability does not require the use of any other
    Telekinesis power. You could not pick the Mastered Succor ability from
    Biopsionics, because that technique is meant to augment another power you
    don’t have.<br>Level 2: You now have a maximum Effort of two points. You may
    pick a second ability according to the guidelines above. This second does
    not need to be a stand-alone technique if it augments the power you chose
    for level 1 of this focus. Thus, if your first pick was gaining the level-0
    power of Psychic Succor, your second could be Mastered Succor. You still
    could not get the level-1 core power of Psychic Succor, however, as you’re
    still restricted to level-0.
