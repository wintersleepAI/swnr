    You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.
    Level 1: You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take this focus after first level. You automatically stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than a Heavy weapon.
    Level 2: The first time each day that you are reduced to zero hit points by an injury, you instead survive with one hit point remaining. This ability canâ€™t save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.
