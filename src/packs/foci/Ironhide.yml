  description: |-
    Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, gengineered skin fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding, you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality combat armor. The benefits of this focus donâ€™t stack with armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.
    Level 1: You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half your character level, rounded up.
    Level 2: Your abilities are so effective that they render you immune to unarmed attacks or primitive weaponry as if you wore powered armor.
