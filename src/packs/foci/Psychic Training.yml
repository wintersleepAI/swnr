  description: 'Youâ€™ve had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial Psychic class option as an Adventurer to pick this focus. In the latter case, you can only take training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial Psychic. As with most foci, this focus can be taken only once.<br><br>Level 1: Gain any psychic skill as a bonus. If this improves it to level-1 proficiency, choose a free level-1 technique from that discipline. Your maximum Effort increases by one.<br>Level 2: When you advance a level, the bonus psychic skill you chose for the first level of the focus automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it. You may save these points for later, if more are required to raise the skill or buy a particular technique. These points are awarded retroactively if you take this focus level later in the game.'
