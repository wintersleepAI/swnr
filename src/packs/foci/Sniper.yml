  description: |-
    You are an expert at placing a bullet or beam on an unsuspecting target. These special benefits only apply when making an Execution Attack with a firearm or bow, as described on page 52.
    Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a skill check for an Execution Attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
    Level 2: A target hit by your Execution Attack takes a -4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal injury. Even if the save is successful, the target takes double the normal damage inflicted by the attack.
