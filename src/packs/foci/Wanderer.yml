  description: 'Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road, theyâ€™ve mastered a number of tricks for ensuring their mobility and surviving the inevitable difficulties of a vagabond existence.<br><br>Level 1: Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey basic ideas in all the common languages of the sector. You can always find free transport to a desired destination for yourself and a small group of your friends provided any traffic goes to the place. Finding this transport takes no more than an hour, but it may not be a strictly legitimate means of travel and may require working passage.<br>Level 2: You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers and identification for the party with 1d6 hoursof work. These papers and permits will stand up to ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/Administer versus Wis/Notice check if examined by an official while the PC is actually wanted by the state for some crime. When finding transport for the party, the transportation always makes the trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter would.'
