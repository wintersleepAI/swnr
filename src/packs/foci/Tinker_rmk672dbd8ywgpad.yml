    You have a natural knack for modifying and improving equipment, as given in
    the rules on page 90.<br><br>Level 1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your
    Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many mods.
    Both ship and gear mods cost only half their usual price in credits, though
    pretech salvage requirements remain the same.<br>Level 2: Your Fix skill is
    treated as one level higher for purposes of building and maintaining mods
    and calculating your Maintenance score. Advanced mods require one fewer
    pretech salvage part to make, down to a minimum of zero.
