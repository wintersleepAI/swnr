  description: >-
    You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in carrying
    out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on page 52.<br><br>Level
    1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no larger than a
    knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including
    normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can draw or produce this object as
    an On Turn action, and your point-blank ranged attacks made from surprise
    with it cannot miss the target.<br>Level 2: You can take a Move action on
    the same round as you make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly with a
    target before you attack. You may split this Move action when making an
    Execution Attack, taking part of it before you murder your target and part
    of it afterwards. This movement happens too quickly to alert a victim or to
    be hindered by bodyguards, barring an actual physical wall of meat between
    you and your prey.
