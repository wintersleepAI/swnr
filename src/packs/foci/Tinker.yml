  description: |-
    You have a natural knack for modifying and improving equipment, as given in the rules on page 90.
    Level 1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many mods. Both ship and gear mods cost only half their usual price in credits, though pretech salvage requirements remain the same.
    Level 2: Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for purposes of building and maintaining mods and calculating your Maintenance score. Advanced mods require one fewer pretech salvage part to make, down to a minimum of zero.
