  description: |-
    Healing comes naturally to you, and youâ€™re particularly gifted at preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades.
    Level 1: Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When rollingHeal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
    Level 2: Stims or other technological healing devices applied by you heal twice as many hit points as normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you can heal 1d6+Heal skill hit points of damage to every injured or wounded person in your group with ten minutes of first aid spread among them. Such healing can be applied to a given target only once per day.
