        Assorted retractable blades and spikes are implanted in the user's
        limbs. Their unarmed attacks do 1d8 damage, Shock of 2/15, Trauma Die
        1d8/x3 and can be rolled with either Stab or Punch as the relevant
        combat skill. The Punch skill does not add damage to Body Blades
        attacks. When not in use, the blades are perceptible only to a medical
        scan.

        While a single cybernetic eye can be implanted, it is recommended that
        both be replaced at the same time to improve neural adaptation. These
        cybereyes are clearly artificial, though most are styled in attractive
        or striking fashions. They all have perfect 20/20 vision and integral
        flash protectors, but additional functionality must be implanted
        separately. A user with a pair of cybereyes or syntheyes halves the
        System Strain cost of cybernetic eye implants.

        Light and heavy pistols are categorized by the caliber of the bullet
        they fire. Some operators prefer the low recoil and high mag capacity
        possible with a low-caliber round, while others like to have a little
        more certainty in dropping the targets they hit.

        The user's hands are implanted with subdermal electrical webbing. As an
        Instant action, accept one System Strain; for the rest of the scene, the
        user's unarmed attacks do an additional 1d8 electrical damage on a
        successful hit. Unarmed attacks augmented with this mod are non-lethal
        if desired. This system does not stack with Body Blades.
