  description: >-
    Little more than a fist-sized drive core with wheels, Shintetsu's Mouse is
    about as small as a functional drone can get with its low-cost technology.
    Incapable of supporting more than its basic functionality, it still provides
    eyes and ears for a pilot in a cheap, portable format.
