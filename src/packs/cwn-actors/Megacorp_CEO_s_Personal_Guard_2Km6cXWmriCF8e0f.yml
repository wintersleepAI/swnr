        Grenades may be thrown at a point within range and always target AC 10.
        On a miss, the grenade bounces 1d10 meters in a random direction before
        exploding. Grenades have a 5-meter radius of effect. Frag grenades
        inflict 2d6 damage on all victims in range, plus the chance for a
        Traumatic Hit. An Evasion save can halve a frag grenade's damage, and
        each point of melee AC the target has above 14 reduces the final damage
        total by one point, possibly down to zero.
