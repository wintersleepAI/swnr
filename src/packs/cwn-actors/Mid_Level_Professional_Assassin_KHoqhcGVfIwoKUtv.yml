        Advanced weapons employ modern polymers, sophisticated metallurgy,
        fractal edges, electro-stun tech, and a small legion of marketers to
        sell products that are distinctly superior to the plain steel edges of a
        prior age. An advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go through bone
        like bamboo and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings. The more
        martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their marketing, with
        some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers inking exclusivity
        deals with particular knife manufacturers.
