        Advanced weapons employ modern polymers, sophisticated metallurgy,
        fractal edges, electro-stun tech, and a small legion of marketers to
        sell products that are distinctly superior to the plain steel edges of a
        prior age. An advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go through bone
        like bamboo and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings. The more
        martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their marketing, with
        some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers inking exclusivity
        deals with particular knife manufacturers.

        A holdout weapon designed for surprise short-ranged attacks, this eye
        has been loaded with a small explosive flechette. It has the statistics

        range who does not suspect its existence, a normal hit roll is made; on

        Aside from allowing free alteration of eye color, this mod allows the
        user to copy another person's retinal patterns. Provided they are within
        two meters, they need only meet the user's gaze for a few moments to get
        a good imprint. The eye can store up to a dozen imprints, but it takes a
        Main Action to shift from one to another. Note that it is a relatively
        simple procedure to alter a person's retinal pattern, so an important
        target alerted to the imposture may end up changing their imprint.

        You have a gift with ranged weapons. While this talent most commonly
        applies to guns, it is also applicable to thrown weapons or other ranged
        weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you
        can't use the benefits of the Armsmaster Focus at the same time as
        Deadeye.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can Ready
        a Stowed ranged weapon as an Instant action. You may use a rifle or
        two-handed ranged weapon even when an enemy is within melee range,
        albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may add your Shoot skill level to a
        ranged weapon's damage roll.<br />Level 2: You can reload guns,
        crossbows, or other slow-loading weapons as an On Turn action, provided
        they don't take more than a round to reload. You can use ranged weapons
        of any size in melee without penalty. Once per scene, as an On Turn
        action when target shooting at an inanimate, non-creature target, you
        automatically hit unless you roll a 2 on your Shoot skill check or the
        shot is physically impossible.
