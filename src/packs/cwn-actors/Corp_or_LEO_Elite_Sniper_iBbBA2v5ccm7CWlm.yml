        The infrared vision this mod allows permits basic navigation in dark
        areas and makes the presence of heat sources such as humans, engines,
        and infrared tripwires very obvious. The user gains a +1 bonus on any
        Notice checks to detect the presence of thermally-unshielded living
        creatures.
      effect: See heat patterns in the area

        Sniper rifles are often nothing more than bolt-action rifles with
        expensive tuning and optics. If not fired from a rest in a prepared
        position, a sniper rifle's statistics are the same as a normal rifle.
        This weapon can be reloaded with a Move action, or an On Turn if the
        user has at least Shoot-1 skill.
