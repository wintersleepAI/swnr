        While a single cybernetic eye can be implanted, it is recommended that
        both be replaced at the same time to improve neural adaptation. These
        cybereyes are clearly artificial, though most are styled in attractive
        or striking fashions. They all have perfect 20/20 vision and integral
        flash protectors, but additional functionality must be implanted
        separately. A user with a pair of cybereyes or syntheyes halves the

        Advanced weapons employ modern polymers, sophisticated metallurgy,

        sell products that are distinctly superior to the plain steel edges of a
        prior age. An advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go through bone
        like bamboo and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings. The more
        martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their marketing, with
        some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers inking exclusivity
        deals with particular knife manufacturers.

      description: >-
        You have a gift with ranged weapons. While this talent most commonly
        applies to guns, it is also applicable to thrown weapons or other ranged
        weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you
        can't use the benefits of the Armsmaster Focus at the same time as
        Deadeye.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can Ready
        a Stowed ranged weapon as an Instant action. You may use a rifle or
        two-handed ranged weapon even when an enemy is within melee range,
        albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may add your Shoot skill level to a
        ranged weapon's damage roll.<br />Level 2: You can reload guns,
        crossbows, or other slow-loading weapons as an On Turn action, provided
        they don't take more than a round to reload. You can use ranged weapons
        of any size in melee without penalty. Once per scene, as an On Turn
        action when target shooting at an inanimate, non-creature target, you
        automatically hit unless you roll a 2 on your Shoot skill check or the
        shot is physically impossible.
