  description: >-
    <p>The adeptâ€™s precognition is sophisticated enough to clearly foresee
    several seconds into the future. As an Instant action, the psychic may
    Commit Effort for the day and declare that what they have just done or seen
    is a vision of the immediate future. Time rolls back to the start of the
    initiative count in a combat turn, or six seconds earlier if out of combat.
    Nothing that happened during that round has really come to pass
    yet.</p><p>This ability is tremendously draining, and can be used only once
    per day.</p>
