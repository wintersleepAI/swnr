  description: <p>As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the scene just before they roll initiative. Their initiative score is treated as one better than anyone elseâ€™s involved in the scene. If another participant has this power or some other ability that grants automatic initiative success, roll initiative normally to determine which of them goes first, and then the rest of the combatants act. This ability cannot be used if the precog has been surprised.</p>
