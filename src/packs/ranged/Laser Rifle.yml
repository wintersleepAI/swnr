  description: Laser pistols and laser rifles are the most common type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light. The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a -4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half.
