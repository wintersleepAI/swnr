  description: >-
    Distortion cannons are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons
    designed before the Scream. These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same
    principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space
    to disrupt a target. Provided the wielder can see a target within range or
    accurately fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon can
    ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the gun and its target
