  description: >-
    You no longer naturally age, and will remain perfectly hale and vigorous up
    to your species' natural maximum age plus 20% per character level, after
    which you will collapse into dust and decay. Immortality beyond this point
    is possible, but generally requires consistent supplies of life energy,
    occult materials, or other difficult-to-acquire or morally questionable
    materials. You also become immune to poisons and diseases.
