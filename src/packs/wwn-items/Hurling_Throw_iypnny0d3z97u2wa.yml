  description: >-
    After you make a successful attack, you may Commit Effort for the scene as
    an Instant action. The target must make a Physical saving throw or be thrown
    up to ten feet in any direction, falling prone on landing and suffering the
    damage rolled for your attack. If the Physical save is successful, the
    target simply takes damage as normal. This art can be used only once per
    round on any given target, and the target must be no larger than an ox.
