    Know matters of history, geography, natural science, zoology, and other
    academic fields appropriate to a sage or scholar. While some sages might
    specialize in particular fields, most learned men and women in this age have
    a broad range of understanding, and will rarely be unable to even attempt to
    answer a question relevant to this skill.
