  description: >-
    This potion is meant to be applied to a restrained, willing, or helpless
    sentient target. The user must envision a specific query before anointing
    the target with the potion. The subject may make a Mental saving throw to
    resist; on a failure, they tell the user a truthful, undeceptive answer to
    their question in no more than five sentences. On a success, the user's
    psychic impression has tainted the elixir, and the target will instead
    instinctively give the answer that the user thinks is most likely or
    plausible in the GM's estimation. The user cannot discern the result of the
    save except by their own good judgment of the answer.
