  description: >-
    Regardless of class, your hit die can't be worse than 1d6 per level. When
    attacking with the Punch skill, your class hit bonus can be no worse than
    that of an Expert of your same character level. At third level, any attack
    using the Punch skill counts as a magic weapon.
