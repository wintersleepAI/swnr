  description: >-
    A brief incantation transforms one visible, willing target per caster level
    into a perfect simulacrum of any humanoid creature the caster has seen
    before, whether a specific individual or a general type. No special
    abilities are granted by this transformation, but the target will perfectly
    resemble a chosen individual, including in voice and scent. Their
    non-magical clothing will transform to whatever clothing is appropriate to
    the target, and they will gain an intuitive ability to speak and understand
    the target's native tongue. The spell lasts until dawn of the day after
    casting it, whereupon the targets and any transformed clothing revert back
    to their original seeming
