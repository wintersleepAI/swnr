  description: >-
    You are an expert at placing a thrown knife or arrow on an unsuspecting
    target. These special benefits only apply when making an Execution Attack
    with a bow, hurlant, or thrown weapon, as described on page 44. Level 1:
    Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a skill check for a ranged
    Execution Attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die. Level
    2: You don't miss ranged Execution Attacks. A target hit by one takes a -4
    penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal injury. Even
    if the save is successful, the target takes double the normal damage
    inflicted by the attack.
