  description: >-
    The user of this potion transforms into a normal animal of their choice no
    larger than a horse nor smaller than a rat. Their own attributes and
    statistics are retained, though they gain the chosen creature's movement
    modes and speed. Their belongings meld with them on the transformation,
    still applying their benefits, but they cannot be removed until the change
    ends. The transformation lasts until the user ends it as an On Turn action,
    they die, or the next dawn.
