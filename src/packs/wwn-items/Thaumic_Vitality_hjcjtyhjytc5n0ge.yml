  description: >-
    A rare and precious potion, this elixir allows a mage to cast one prepared
    spell within the next scene without it counting against their allowed spells
    for the day. This force exerts a severe cost on their bodily constitution,
    however, and they gain Systm Strain equal to the spell's level after it is
    cast. If this cost is more than their Constitution can bear, they fall
    unconscious and wake up in fifteen minutes with maximized System Strain.
