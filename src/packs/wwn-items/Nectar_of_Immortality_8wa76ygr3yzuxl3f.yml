  description: >-
    Grandly named, this liquid offers a nominal prolongation of the subject's
    natural longevity. Sages speculate that it was once a reward given by the
    Outsiders to pliant human rulers. Each bottle consumed adds an additional
    1d6 years to the subject's healthy lifespan and immediately cures all but
    the most sorcerously-potent diseases or sicknesses. The nectar cannot do
    more than double the subject's natural lifespan, however, and after each
    dose a 1d20 must be rolled; on a natural 1, the nectar instead causes the
    subject to perish in a hideous welter of cancers and rebellious growths.
