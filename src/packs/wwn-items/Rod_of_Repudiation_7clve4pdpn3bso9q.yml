  description: >-
    An ancient punishment-tool, this short rod may be used to strike a target in
    melee as if a club +1 or used against a helpless target automatically. An
    affected subject must make a Physical saving throw or have a dully-glowing
    brand appear on their face. This brand inspires universal, unreasoning
    loathing in humans and demihumans, causing a -2 penalty to all their
    reaction rolls and a -2 penalty to all Charisma-based skill checks. Friends,
    lovers, spouses, and others with close relationships must make a Mental
    saving throw on first seeing the brand or break off all association with the
    subject. The rod may inflict such a brand once per scene, and the curse
    lasts until it is dispelled or the rod is used again on the same target.
