    Duration: 12 turns Range: 10' around the caster This spell wards the caster
    and all allies within 10' from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as
    follows: ▶ Bonuses: Those warded gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against
    attacks or special abilities of affected creatures. ▶ Affected creatures'
    attacks: Against those warded are penalised by &ndash;1. ▶ Enchanted,
    constructed, or summoned creatures: The spell additionally prevents such
    creatures from making melee attacks against those warded, though they may
    still make ranged attacks. If any of the warded party engages such a
    creature in melee, this protection is broken (those warded still gain the
    save and attack bonuses mentioned above).
