  description: >-
    A fist-sized crystal acts as a locus for manifesting a strange,
    geometric-looking steed of translucent force. The ghost horse can be
    summoned as a Main Action, and will dutifully and fearlessly carry its
    summoner and up to two hundred pounds of weight or thirty-five points of
    encumbrance for up to twelve hours before needing an equal amount of time to
    recharge. A ghost horse has an effective Move of 60' per action and can
    cross any terrain a mountain goat or small boat could navigate, moving up to
    50 miles in the course of twelve hours. Natural animals shy away from the
    beast. The ghost horse has an effective AC of 13, 20 hit points, and cannot
    fight; if destroyed, it collapses back into its locus and cannot be recalled
    for a week.
