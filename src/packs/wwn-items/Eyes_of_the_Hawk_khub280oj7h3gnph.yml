  description: >-
    This shape has remarkably acute senses. You can scent trails and objects
    like a dog, hear very faint noises, see objects clearly enough to identify
    faces at a thousand feet of distance, and see clearly in anything short of
    complete darkness. You gain a +2 bonus on all sensory Notice checks.
