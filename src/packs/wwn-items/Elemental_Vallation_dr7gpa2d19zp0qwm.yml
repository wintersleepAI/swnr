  description: >-
    A wall of a chosen churning elemental force can be called up by the
    elementalist. The barrier is ten feet long per character level, with a
    height of ten feet and a thickness of one foot. The barrier must rest on
    solid ground but may be bent or shaped as desired so long as no part of it
    &bull;77 is more than two hundred feet from the caster. Earthen walls are
    impervious to anything but mining-appropriate tools or rock-shattering
    strength, taking 20 HP of damage to knock a man-sized hole in them. Fire
    walls inflict [[/roll 3d6]] damage plus the elementalist's level on anyone
    who passes through them. Water walls spin and hurl creatures of ox-size or
    less who pass through them, ejecting them at a random point on the far side
    of the wall and doing [[/roll 2d6]] damage from the buffeting. Air walls are
    invisible, inaudible, and twenty feet in height; those who cross them suffer
    1d6 plus the elementalist's level in electrical damage. The walls vanish at
    the end of the scene.
