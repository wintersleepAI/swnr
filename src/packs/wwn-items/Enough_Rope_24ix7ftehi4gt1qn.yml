  description: >-
    When found, this appears to be a simple loop of slim silk rope, no more than
    five feet long. Whenever this rope is actually used, however, it will always
    be precisely long enough for the immediate task at hand, be that climbing a
    wall, binding enemies, casting a line over a crevasse, or some other
    specific use. The rope can bear up to a ton of weight and cannot be cut by
    non-magical weapons. So long as the owner is touching the rope, they can
    cause it to untie itself or retract fully back into their grip.
