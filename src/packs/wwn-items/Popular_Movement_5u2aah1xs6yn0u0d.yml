  description: >-
    Any friendly Asset is allowed movement into the same location as the Popular
    Movement, even if it would normally be forbidden by its owners and lacks the
    Subtle quality. If the Popular Movement later moves or is destroyed, such
    Assets must also leave or suffer the usual consequences of a non-Subtle
    Asset in a hostile area.
