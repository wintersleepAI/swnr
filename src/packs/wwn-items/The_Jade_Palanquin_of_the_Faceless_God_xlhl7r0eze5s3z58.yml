  description: >-
    This spell calls forth a floating palanquin of ornately-carved green stone.
    A slim three-foot-tall statue of a faceless entity stands at the center of
    the platform, while four slender pillars rise at the corners, the roof and
    sides being draped by metallic golden cloth. The palanquin itself is twelve
    feet long and eight wide, with room enough for several people to sit on it.
    It floats at shoulder-height above the ground or a liquid surface below. It
    does not move of its own, but may be pulled along by even one human-sized
    bearer. The total burden on the palanquin cannot exceed more than two
    thousand pounds, or it sinks to the ground. It lasts until dusk, dawn, or
    until the statue of the god is struck or insulted, whichever comes first.
