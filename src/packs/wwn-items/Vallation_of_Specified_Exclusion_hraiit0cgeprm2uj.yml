  description: >-
    The caster must form some sort of line as part of this spell's invocation,
    either with dropped powders or a trace drawn in the dirt or a more permanent
    inlay into a floor. In extremis, the caster can make such a line as part of
    a Move action, tracing it out or scattering powder as they go. The line
    itself may be no longer than twenty feet per caster level, and may be
    straight or curved as the caster wishes. Once it has been drawn, this spell
    may be cast, empowering the line with the ability to ward off a particular
    target and prevent them or their powers from crossing or being made to cross
    the line, as if it were a physical wall. The caster can nominate any kind of
    target to be warded that could be distinguished without need for knowing
    their thoughts, such as "humans" or "non-humans" or "men wearing the livery
    of the baron". The barrier extends a hundred feet upward and ten feet
    downward and blocks any attack or magical power used by those warded. If the
    excluded creatures are attacked or targeted by powers from the other side of
    the barrier, however, the entire field shatters. The barrier lasts until
    dispelled, the caster drops it, or until one hour has passed per caster
    level.
