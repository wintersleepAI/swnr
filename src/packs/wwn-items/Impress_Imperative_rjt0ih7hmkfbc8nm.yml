  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action while targeting a visible living
    creature. You may give it an overwhelming urge to perform some action that
    takes no longer than a round and is not completely contrary to its nature or
    wishes. It can make a Mental save to resist, but on a failure it spends its
    next action carrying out the imperative.
