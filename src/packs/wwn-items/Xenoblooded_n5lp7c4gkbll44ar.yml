  description: >-
    You have been both blessed and cursed by the Outsiders, gaining the ability
    to survive in alien environments that humans were never meant to tolerate.
    This may be from ancient modifications made to your lineage in order to make
    them better servants, or it could be that you're some sort of alien-human
    hybrid yourself. Those cursed with such a hated heritage usually have
    considerable physical variations from human normality, and usually try to
    pass themselves off as merely an unusual kind of demihuman or unfortunate
    human mutant. Level 1: Choose one set of benefits from the list below to
    reflect your alien heritage. Other gifts may exist. You are immune to heat
    damage and can breathe and see through smoke without hindrance. You are
    water-adapted and can breathe water and see through it up to 120' regardless
    of light. You swim at double your normal Move rate. You were built to
    heavier or lighter gravity conditions; gain a +1 to either your Strength or
    Dexterity modifiers, to a maximum of +3, and a -1 penalty to the modifier of
    the other attribute. You are nourished by invisible radiations and need
    neither eat, sleep, nor breathe. You can see clearly even in the absence of
    any light.
