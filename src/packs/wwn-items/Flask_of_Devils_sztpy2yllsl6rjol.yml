  description: >-
    This brass flask is tightly stoppered and covered with sigils of sealing and
    dominion. If opened, a hideous devil-thing leaps out of the bottle, having
    statistics equivalent to a creature called by the
    @UUID[Compendium.wwn.arts.Item.pc8jwXR7JUYG2TNE]{Calculation of the
    Phantasmal Eidolon} spell on page 68. The devil will demand that its
    liberator give it a command; that command will be faithfully followed until
    the scene is over or it is completed. Once finished, the devil will be drawn
    back into the flask. Each use of the flask adds 1 System Strain to the user;
    if the devil is killed, an additional 1d3 System Strain is gained by the
    user and a new devil will be summoned forth the next time the flask is
    opened. If this System Strain is sufficient to take the user over their
    maximum, they're dragged into the flask to become its new devil, lost
    forever without some heroic labor of rescue. The flask can be opened only
    once per day.
