  description: >-
    You have an uncanny ability to sniff out traders and find good deals, licit
    or otherwise. Even those who might not normally be disposed to bargain with
    you can sometimes be persuaded to pause and negotiate, if you have something
    they want. Level 1: Gain Trade as a bonus skill. With a half hour of effort
    you can find a buyer or seller for any good or service that can be traded in
    the community, legal or otherwise. Finding a marginally possible service,
    like an assassin willing and able to target a king, or some specific
    precious ancient artifact, may require an adventure if the GM allows it at
    all. Level 2: Once per session, target a sentient who is not just then
    trying to kill you or your allies and make a request of it that it can
    comprehend. If it's at all plausible for it to make such terms, it will do
    so for a price or favor it thinks you can grant, though the price for
    significant favors might be dear.
