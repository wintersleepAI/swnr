  description: >-
    The caster conjures up a semi-real phantasmal creature in any shape or
    appearance they desire, provided it is no larger than an ox. The servitor is
    as intelligent as a human and will obey the caster with fearless and
    suicidal devotion, having 4 effective hit dice, 20 hit points, AC 15, a
    movement rate of 30' per action, a +1 skill modifier, saves of 13+, and a
    +6/1d8 damage melee attack with 2/ AC 15 Shock. As the creature is partly
    phantasmal, the damage it inflicts cannot kill a subject, but only knock
    them unconscious for an hour before they awaken with 1 hit point. The caster
    may pick one special quality for the creature when it is summoned: the
    ability to fly at a rate of 30'/move, the perfect duplication of a
    particular person they've seen, the ability to form a telepathic speech
    connection with the caster, or the ability to effectively use normal
    weaponry and armor. The servitor lasts until destroyed or the dawn after the
    spell is cast.
