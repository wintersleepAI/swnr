    As an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the scene. The next attack you make
    that round will leave the target unable to cast spells or trigger Mage arts
    for the rest of the round, even if the attack misses. Currently-active arts
    are not disrupted. If the attack is successfully Screened by an ally,
    however, the target is unaffected.
