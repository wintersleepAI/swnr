  description: >-
    Only expert healers are capable of mastering this art, which cannot be
    learned earlier than 8th level. Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action
    to revive a recently-slain living creature that you are touching. This
    ability must be used on a target within one minute per caster level of their
    death, and will not work on a corpse that has been dismembered, incinerated,
    or otherwise disjected. The target's System Strain is automatically
    maximized and they'll be unconscious for twenty-four hours after their
    restoration before awakening with 1 hit point.
