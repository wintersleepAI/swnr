  description: >-
    The caster opens a short-ranged spatial rift between two points within one
    hundred feet per level, provided they can see or have physically occupied
    both points at some prior time and provided the two points are at least
    twenty feet apart. The rift forms a gateway that connects the two points,
    one large enough to drive a cart through, and allows subjects on either side
    to see through and pass through the gate. Ambient environmental qualities
    such as liquids or atmospheres will not pass through the portal; only
    intentionally-directed creatures and objects will transfer. Once the
    creature has passed through a portal, it cannot pass through again until its
    next turn. The portal remains open for up to one round per caster level, but
    can be shut as an Instant action by the caster. Creatures partially in a
    rift when it closes are spat out on the far side.
