  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent Range: 120' This spell has three usages: 1. Conjuring
    light: In a 30' radius. The magical light is as bright as full daylight
    (creatures that suffer attack penalties in daylight are affected). The spell
    may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
    2. Blinding a creature: By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target
    fails an Evasion save, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack. 3.
    Cancelling darkness: Continual light may cancel a continual darkness spell
    (see below). Reversed: Continual Darkness Creates a 30' radius area of
    magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and infravision. Light
    sources brought within the area of darkness do not illuminate it. Like
    continual light, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to
    dispel a continual light spell.
