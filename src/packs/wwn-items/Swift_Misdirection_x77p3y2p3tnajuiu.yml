  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action and target one intelligent
    creature within earshot. Tell them something in no more than one sentence;
    unless what you say is physically impossible or emotionally unendurable,
    they must make a Mental save or believe it for one round. After that, they
    can judge your words with their normal reason. This art can affect a
    creature only once per scene.
