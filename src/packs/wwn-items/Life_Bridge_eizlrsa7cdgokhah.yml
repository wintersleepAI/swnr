  description: >-
    You can transfer life force between willing or helpless participants. Commit
    Effort for the day; for the rest of the scene, you can shift hit points from
    one willing or helpless target no smaller than a dog to another as a Main
    Action, provided you are touching both. You can shift enough hit points to
    Mortally Wound a donor, but you can't give more to the recipient than would
    refresh their maximum allowed hit points.
