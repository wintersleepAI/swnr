  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action when talking to an intelligent
    target when not in combat. They must make a Mental save or become dazed,
    oblivious to their surroundings and forgetting you and all else that
    happened in that scene. Danger ends the daze but not the forgetting.
