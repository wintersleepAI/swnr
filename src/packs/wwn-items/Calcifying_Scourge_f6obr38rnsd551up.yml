  description: >-
    A visible target within one hundred feet must make a Physical saving throw
    or be turned to stone. Any size of living creature may be so transmuted,
    though inanimate objects larger than a cart cannot. Objects being held or
    worn by someone else get a Physical saving throw made by their user. The
    calcification remains until dispelled or the caster undoes the magic, but if
    the object or creature is damaged in the meanwhile, it may end up being
    harmed or killed on its restoration. If the Physical saving throw is made
    successfully by a creature, the target is temporarily slowed, losing its
    Move action for the next 1d6 rounds.
