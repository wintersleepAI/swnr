  description: >-
    Duration: Concentration Range: 60' An immobile, opaque curtain of
    shimmering, violet fire springs into existence. ▶ Size: The wall can be any
    size, and may be shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster
    desires, up to 1,200 sq. ft. For example, it may be a straight wall or
    curved into a protective circle. ▶ Location: The wall may not be evoked so
    that it appears where objects are. ▶ Monsters with fewer than 4 HD: Cannot
    pass the wall of flames. ▶ Monsters with 4 or more HD: Take 1d6 hit points
    of damage when they pass through the wall. The wall deals double damage to
    undead creatures or creatures that use cold or are accustomed to cold. ▶
    Concentration: The wall persists as long as the caster concentrates on the
    spell and does not move.
