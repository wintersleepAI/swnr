  description: >-
    A constant flow of observations runs back to the faction from these watchful
    counterintelligence agents. Whenever another faction moves a Stealthed asset
    into a location within one move's distance from the Vigilant Agents, they
    may make a Cunning vs. Cunning attack against the owning faction. On a
    success, the intruding Asset loses its Stealth after it completes the move.
