  description: >-
    You've had all too much practice at close-in fighting and desperate
    struggles with drawn blades. You're extremely skilled at avoiding injury in
    melee combat, and at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without
    fear of being knifed in passing. Level 1: Gain any combat skill as a bonus
    skill. You can use knife-sized thrown weapons in melee without suffering
    penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock damage from
    melee assailants, even if you're unarmored at the time, but invoking this
    benefit disrupts any spellcasting you might do that round due to the need
    for violently active evasion. Level 2: The Shock damage from your melee
    attacks treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting Withdrawal
    combat action is treated as an On Turn action for you and can be performed
    freely
