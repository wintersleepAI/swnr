  description: >-
    Sigiled and worked with signs of rule, this hand drum will produce an
    immediate deluge of rain in a hundred-foot radius around the user when it is
    beaten rhythmically. The rain lasts no more than one round but will drop
    three inches of water on all surfaces within the area of effect; if used
    indoors, the rain issues from the room's ceiling. The drum can be used
    safely once per day. Each additional time it is used in the same day, it
    adds 1 System Strain to the user.
