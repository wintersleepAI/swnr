  description: >-
    You can conjure petty amounts of flame, water, ice, stone, or wind,
    sufficient to do small tricks, chill drinks, light candles, or do other
    minor things. Conjured substances last no longer than a scene, and conjured
    water cannot lastingly quench thirst. This art cannot actually be useful in
    solving a problem or overcoming a challenge more than once per game session.
