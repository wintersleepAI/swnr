  description: >-
    Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of metal, can
    be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to hold and manipulate
    objects with that hand. Larger shields require the use of a gripping hand,
    but are usually of cheaper, lighter wood. A small shield user has a base AC
    of 13, while a large shield user has a base AC of 14. Unlike other armor,
    however, if the user is already wearing equal or better armor the shield
    grants a +1 bonus to their AC. Shields allow the bearer to ignore the first
    instance of Shock they might otherwise suffer in a round. Magical shields do
    not have enchantment bonuses that add to the user's Armor Class. Instead,
    they're empowered with unique abilities or benefits that apply to the
    bearer. Magical shields cannot be ruined with the Shatter Shield combat
    maneuver mentioned on page 44, though they can be destroyed by intentional
    abuse.
