  description: >-
    Anyone with any level of Ride skill can fight competently on horseback or
    keep their mount healthy. You have an almost supernatural bond with your
    steeds, however, and can push them beyond normal limits. Level 1: Gain Ride
    as a bonus skill. Your steeds all count as Morale 12 in battle, use your AC
    if it's higher than theirs, and can travel 50% further in a day than normal
    for their kind. You can intuitively communicate with riding beasts, gaining
    as much information from it as its intellect can convey. Level 2: Once per
    scene, negate a successful attack against your steed as an Instant action.
    Once per scene, reroll any failed Ride skill check. You can telepathically
    send and receive simple warnings, thoughts, and commands to and from your
    steed so long as it's within two hundred feet. You can so bond with one
    steed at a time, taking an hour to do so.
