  description: >-
    A flattened disc of tremendous heat, sound, and shock is triggered at a
    visible point within fifty feet per caster level, erupting in a twenty-foot
    radius eight feet in height. Everything within the area suffers 1d8 damage
    from flame, concussion, and sonic shock per caster level, with an Evasion
    save for half. If used in a space less than 40 feet in width, the explosion
    is channeled through adjacent spaces and passages for an additional [[/roll
    1d6]] x 10 feet.
