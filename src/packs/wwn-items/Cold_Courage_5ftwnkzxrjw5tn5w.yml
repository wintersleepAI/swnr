  description: >-
    The user of this potion is filled with invincible confidence and perfect
    self-assurance for the rest of the scene, fighting as calmly in bloody
    battle as if on a sparring field. When they attack, they roll a skill check
    instead of an attack roll, at a difficulty equal to half the target's Armor
    Class, rounded down. They are also immune to any mental effect that would
    alter their emotions. While under the potion's influence, however, the GM
    keeps track of their hit points and damage taken, and the player is told
    only when they hit zero.
