  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action while performing. You evoke a
    desired emotion in listeners, whether intelligent or animal, granting a +1
    bonus to relevant social skill checks for the scene for you and your allies.
    If desired, you can force a new Reaction Roll, taking it if it's more
    favorable than the original. This art does not work in combat and can be
    used only once per scene.
