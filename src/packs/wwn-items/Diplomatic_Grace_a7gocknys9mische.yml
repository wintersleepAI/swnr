  description: >-
    Your skill at personal negotiations is enormous and uncanny. Some might even
    think it is supernatural in origin. Level 1: Gain Convince as a bonus skill.
    You speak all the languages common to your region of the world and can learn
    new ones to a workable level in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll
    1s on any skill check dice related to negotiation or diplomacy. Level 2:
    Once per day, silently consecrate a bargain; the target must make a Mental
    save to break the deal unless their life or something they love as much is
    imperiled by it. Most NPCs won't even try to break it. The deal must be for
    something specific and time-limited, and not an open-ended bargain.
