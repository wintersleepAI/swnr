  description: >-
    With a day's work in a location you can find and bind a suitable animal
    companion. If looking for a particular type of companion, it must be found
    in the area and may require a Wis/Survive skill check at a difficulty of 10
    or more if it's a particularly rare creature. If you encounter a suitable
    animal on an adventure, you may bind it as a Main Action, with the creature
    allowed a Mental saving throw to resist and become impervious to your
    powers. You may release a companion as a Main Action if you no longer wish
    its service or want to bind a different beast.
