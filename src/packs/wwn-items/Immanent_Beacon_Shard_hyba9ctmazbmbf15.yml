  description: >-
    Fragments of some unfathomable monolith of congealed natural law, these
    shards of faceted crystal are usually the size of a short baton. When a user
    presses the correct facet of the crystal and releases it, the shard remains
    fixed precisely in that location, even if hanging in mid-air. Absolutely no
    mundane force can shift or damage the crystal, and even magical powers must
    dispel the effect at difficulty 12 before the shard can be affected in any
    way. The person who placed the shard is perpetually aware of its exact
    location in relation to their present place, and can see and hear the area
    around the beacon as if they were standing there. The user can reclaim the
    beacon at a cost of 1 System Strain, or wait for the effect to wear out and
    the shard to become movable again a day later.
