  description: >-
    This elixir will cause the subject to either shrink or grow as they wish,
    compacting down to a shape no smaller than three inches or expanding to one
    no larger than twelve feet in height. Once their size is chosen it remains
    fixed for the remaining thirty-minute duration of the potion, or until they
    voluntarily end it. Shrunken characters have an effective Strength of 3 and
    can't do meaningful combat damage. Their Move rating is also cut by 90%, but
    they automatically pass all Sneak skill checks unless someone is actively
    looking for them. Large characters have an effective Strength of 18 and do
    double damage with melee weapons and Shock, but their large size allows all
    foes to roll hit rolls twice against them and take the better number. If the
    character expands in a location not big enough to contain them, they inflict
    4d6 damage on whatever they're expanding in; if it's not enough to destroy
    the constriction, they are crushed to death.
