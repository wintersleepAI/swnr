    This substance allows an imbiber to briefly subconsciously integrate with a
    Deep's basic structure, gaining an insight into the general layout of
    proximate areas. The GM gives the PC a map of the four nearest rooms of
    interest to the PC and instructions on how to get to them. For places with a
    detailed map, a radius of 100' is discerned. Each room's original purpose is
    revealed in a few words, though nothing can be discerned of its contents.
    This elixir will work inside any structure that was intentionally
    constructed by an intelligent being.
