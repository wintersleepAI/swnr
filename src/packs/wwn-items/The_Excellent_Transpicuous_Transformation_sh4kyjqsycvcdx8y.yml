  description: >-
    The mage chooses up to one visible willing target per caster level provided
    they are within 100 feet, though afterwards the targets can separate freely.
    The targets and all they wear or carry become perfectly transparent. Missile
    attacks against invisible foes are largely impossible, and melee attacks
    against them usually suffer a -4 penalty to hit rolls. The spell lasts for
    up to an hour per caster level, but it breaks if a subject performs some
    violent motion, such as running, attacking, or casting a spell. Once broken
    for one subject, it breaks for all.
