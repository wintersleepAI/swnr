  description: >-
    A branch of skilled teamsters, transport ships, road-building crews, or
    other logistical facilitators is in service to the faction. As a free action
    once per faction turn, it can bring an allied Asset to its location,
    provided they're within one turn's movement range, or move an allied Asset
    from its own location to a target also within a turn's move. Multiple
    Military Transport assets can chain this movement over long distances.
