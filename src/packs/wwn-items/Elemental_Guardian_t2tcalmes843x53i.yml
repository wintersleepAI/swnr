  description: >-
    The elementalist imbues a human-sized mass of earth, water, fire, or air
    with a crude awareness and an eagerness to defend them. Whatever the
    substance used, it now has 4 HD, AC 15, a Move of 40'/action, a +1 skill
    bonus, saves of 13+, Morale of 12, and a melee attack of +6/1d10 with no
    Shock. If called from earth, it has 6 hit dice, albeit its other stats don't
    change. If called from fire, it does 5/- Shock damage. If summoned from
    water, it has an AC of 18, and if called from air, it can fly at its usual
    movement rate. It has a human degree of intelligence, can communicate with
    others and manipulate objects, and serves with suicidal devotion. Only one
    elemental guardian can be summoned at any one time, and if destroyed, a new
    one cannot be called that same scene. A guardian persists until destroyed or
    until the dawn after they have been summoned.
