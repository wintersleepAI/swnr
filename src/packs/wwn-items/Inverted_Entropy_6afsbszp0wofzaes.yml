  description: >-
    This flask contains enough of this fluid to affect one man-sized object. If
    the target is unliving, it can be restored to full and perfect physical
    completeness from any degree of damage or destruction, albeit magical
    qualities are not restored. A living target is restored to their last
    condition of full physical health, but the neural tissue reset causes them
    to completely forget everything since that point and maximizes their System
    Strain. The Inverted Entropy can't revert them more than one week. This
    reversion does not delete experience points, magical effects, or lingering
    curses.
