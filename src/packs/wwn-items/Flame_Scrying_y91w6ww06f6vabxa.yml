  description: >-
    The elementalist becomes aware of the approximate locations of all open
    flames within thirty feet per caster level. They may choose one of those
    flames as a focus for the scrying, allowing them to see and hear everything
    around the flame as if they were present. The spell's duration lasts for as
    long as the elementalist remains motionlessly focused on it; during this
    duration, they may switch their focus between the various flames in range as
    they wish.
