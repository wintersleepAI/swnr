  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and target a visible ally;
    for one round per caster level, the target can fly at their usual movement
    rate. If the art ends while they are still in the air, they descend
    harmlessly to the ground. This art may also be used as an Instant action to
    negate falling damage for any single target.
