  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent Range: 60' This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead
    creatures into undead skeletons or zombies: ▶ Obedient: They obey the
    caster's commands. ▶ Special abilities: They are unable to use any special
    abilities (including spell casting) that they possessed in life. ▶ Duration:
    They remain animated until they are destroyed or until a dispel magic spell
    is cast upon them. Number: The spell animates a number of Hit Dice of
    zombies or skeletons equal to the caster's level: ▶ Skeletons: Have AC 12
    and HD equal to those the creature had in life. ▶ Zombies: Have AC 11 and HD
    one greater than the creature had in life. ▶ Classed characters: If a PC or
    NPC with levels in a class is reanimated by this spell, the levels are not
    counted as HD. For example, the reanimated corpse of a 5th level fighter
    would have 2 HD (1 HD as a normal human, +1 for being reanimated as a
    zombie).
