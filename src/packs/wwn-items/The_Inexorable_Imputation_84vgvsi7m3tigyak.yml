  description: >-
    The caster makes a single one-sentence statement as part of casting this
    spell, a process which is subtle enough to appear as no more than ordinary
    conversation. All who hear the caster speak within a forty-foot radius must
    make a Mental saving throw or come to immediately believe the statement is
    true unless it seems physically impossible to them or it is emotionally
    intolerable to believe. The listeners must be able to understand the
    caster's language, and the caster may exempt up to two targets per caster
    level from this delusion when casting the spell, so as to avoid beguiling
    their companions. The spell's effects linger for one hour per caster level,
    after which the believers will be no more persuaded of the fact than events
    or their own common sense would allow
