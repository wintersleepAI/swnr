  description: >-
    This liquid eases a tormented mind and can cure mental illnesses and temper
    the pain of past traumas. Madness induced by magical causes forces the
    subject to make a Mental saving throw; on a failure, the draught cannot
    break the curse. A subject can benefit from Nepenthe only once in their
    life.
