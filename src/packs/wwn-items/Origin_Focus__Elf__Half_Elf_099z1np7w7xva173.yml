  description: >-
    Where there are both elves and humans, half-elves tend to be inevitable
    additions to a campaign world. This Focus follows the "between two worlds"
    flavor of most half-elf interpretations. Level 1: Gain Connect and any one
    skill as bonus skills. You can see out to thirty feet in any light condition
    short of perfect darkness. At your discretion, if you take after your elven
    parent, you may increase your Dexterity modifier by +1 but then also take a
    -1 to your Constitution modifier.
