  description: >-
    A wash of debilitating force erupts in a 20-foot radius at a visible point
    within one hundred feet. All living creatures within the area must make a
    Physical saving throw or for the rest of the scene their movement rate is
    halved and they must make all attack and damage rolls twice and take the
    worse result. If the save is successful, these penalties apply only to their
    next turn.
