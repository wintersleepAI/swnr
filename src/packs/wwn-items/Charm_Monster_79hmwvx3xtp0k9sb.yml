  description: >-
    Duration: One or more days (see below) Range: 120' This spell places a charm
    upon either [[3d6]] creatures of 3 HD or less or a single creature of more
    than 3 HD. Each subject must make a Mental save or be charmed as follows: ▶
    Friendship: The subject regards the caster as its trusted friend and ally
    and will come to the caster's defence. ▶ Commands: If they share a language,
    the caster may give the charmed creature commands, which it will obey. ▶
    Subject's nature: Commands that contradict the charmed creature's habits or
    alignment may be ignored. ▶ Suicidal commands: An affected creature never
    obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Restrictions: Undead are not
    affected. Duration: The charm lasts indefinitely, but the subject is allowed
    to make further Mental saves at intervals, depending on its INT score. If
    one of these saves succeeds, the spell ends. ▶ INT 3&ndash;8: The creature
    gains a new save once every month. ▶ INT 9&ndash;12: The creature gains a
    new save each week ▶ INT 13&ndash;18: The creature gains a new save once
    every day.
