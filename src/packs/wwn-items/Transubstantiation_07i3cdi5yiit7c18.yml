  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to transform up to a gallon of
    any liquid into sacred blood. A draught of this holy liquid is sufficient to
    sustain a drinker for a day without further food or drink and will heal 1d6
    plus the user's Pray skill in lost hit points. A gallon of blood is
    sufficient to help a half-dozen people. The benefits of this art can be
    enjoyed only once per day, and any undrunk blood sublimates away within a
    minute.
