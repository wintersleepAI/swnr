  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent Range: Appears in the caster's presence A dead character
    is returned to life in a new physical form that manifests in the presence of
    the caster. The character's new body is not necessarily the same as the
    original; it is determined by rolling on the Reincarnated Class table
    opposite. The roll indicates either a character class or a monster: ▶
    Character class: The character is of experience level [[1d6]] (or at most
    the same level as the character achieved before death). The reincarnated
    character can continue to gain experience and advance as normal, in the new
    class. ▶ Monster: The type should be determined by the referee. The monster
    should be at least partially intelligent, have no greater Hit Dice than the
    level of the character being reincarnated (at most 6 HD), and be of the same
    alignment. The tables opposite may be used, or the referee may create their
    own tables. Monsters cannot gain experience or advance in level.
