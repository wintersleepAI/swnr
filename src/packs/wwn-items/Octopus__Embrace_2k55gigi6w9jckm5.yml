    This shape can have more than four usable limbs. These additional tentacles,
    arms, legs, or grippers can hold and manipulate things; up to four Stowed
    objects can be held Ready by these limbs without counting against your
    Readied Encumbrance limit. These extra limbs cannot effectively employ extra
    shields, perform additional attacks or actions, or do other things that
    require significant focus beyond your current action.
