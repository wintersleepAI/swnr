  description: >-
    The qualities of a corpse are forced upon a visible living target. The
    subject begins to rot, fester, and decay in whatever ways the necromancer
    thinks appropriate. Food tastes like ashes, water does not quench thirst,
    and their body is numb to all physical pleasures. They suffer a -2 penalty
    to all social skill checks due to their repugnance. This transformation does
    not inflict physical injury, but it makes the target's life an utterly
    joyless misery until it is dispelled or the necromancer lifts the curse.
    Creatures with more hit dice than the necromancer has levels can make a
    Physical save to resist the curse.
