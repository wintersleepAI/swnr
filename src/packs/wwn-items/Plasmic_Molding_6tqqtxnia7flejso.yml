  description: >-
    When applied to a non-magical object no larger than a large door the
    substance becomes soft and malleable as clay for one scene. At the end of
    the scene, the material hardens back to its original consistency in whatever
    form it now takes. If taken by a living creature, they may reshape their own
    body to a degree, taking any appearance that a creature of their species
    might naturally have. This alteration lasts until dispelled or the user ends
    it, but they can't recover System Strain while so altered.
