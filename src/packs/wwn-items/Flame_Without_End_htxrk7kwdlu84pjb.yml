  description: >-
    A sample of flame no larger than the caster is made effectively eternal. It
    no longer consumes the object it burns, though it can still be used to burn
    or heat other things, and it resists all extinguishing save being buried or
    wholly immersed in water. The elementalist can temporarily extinguish it at
    will. A number of such flames can be created equal to the elementalist's
    level; beyond that, special ingredients and fuels are needed that price 500
    silver pieces per flame. If used as a weapon, it adds +2 damage to a
    successful hit, albeit nothing to Shock. The flame lasts until dispelled,
    extinguished, or the elementalist releases it.
  duration: Until dispelled or smothered
