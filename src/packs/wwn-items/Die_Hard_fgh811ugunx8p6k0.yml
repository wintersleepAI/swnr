    Die Hard You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear
    up under stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero. Level 1:
    You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per level. This bonus applies
    retroactively if you take this Focus after first level. You automatically
    stabilize if mortally wounded, provided you have not been incinerated,
    dismembered, or otherwise torn apart. Level 2: The first time each day that
    you are reduced to zero hit points by an injury, you instead survive with
    one hit point remaining. This ability can't save you from large-scale,
    instantly-lethal trauma.
