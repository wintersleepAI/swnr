  description: >-
    Your lineage was cursed by some sadistic sorcerer-king or merciless alien
    artificer. Perhaps an ancestor offended them, or your people were dominated
    and made perpetual tools of their conquerors, or your forebears were a
    fallen ruling caste rendered permanently incapable of threatening the new
    order. You have been terribly compromised in some physical or mental way.
    Despite this curse, you have somehow managed to avoid complete
    incapacitation from it and have done your best to compensate for your
    limitations. Level 1: Choose an attribute; its modifier suffers a permanent
    -2 penalty, to a maximum of -3. Only one of your attribute scores can be
    above 13; reduce any others to no more than 13. You may pick two additional
    Foci to reflect the efforts you've made to overcome your natural limits.
    Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws to reflect your indomitable spirit. You
    cannot pick the Developed Attribute Focus.
