  description: >-
    Hurlants are a wide range of ancient and modern projectile weapons that
    launch specially-prepared charges through various means, both sorcerous and
    semi-scientific. The tremendous accumulation of ancient Legacy manipulations
    intended to disarm subject populations and restrict advanced weaponry to a
    given age's ruling caste has made it very difficult to create firearms, as
    most conventional chemical or magical reactions are specifically disrupted
    by the Legacy. Hand hurlants are usually pistol-sized, most often carried by
    the wealthy as a single-shot opener at the start of hostilities. Long
    hurlants are rifle-sized weapons favored by elite snipers and assassins who
    don't expect a need for a second shot. Great hurlants are usually eight feet
    long and a hundred pounds in weight, and launch tremendous bolts that can
    transfix even monstrous targets. Those able to afford their use generally
    mount them on ships, gun carriages, or on important fortifications. Hurlants
    are too expensive and difficult to craft to be practical as widespread
    military weapons in most regions. In some areas, even hurlants fail to
    function correctly; a GM who prefers not to include them can simply disallow
    them in their own campaign region.
