  description: >-
    You are a self-willed automaton, gaining all the usual benefits and
    limitations of that state. You probably have a humanoid form; at your
    option, you can be human-like enough that only a close inspection reveals
    your nature. While you are capable of eating and drinking, it is not
    necessary for you. As with other origin Foci, it's up to the GM to decide
    whether or not this option fits well with their campaign, and it may be
    disallowed at their discretion. Level 1: You have an automaton's traits and
    qualities. You gain System Strain as normal for a living creature when
    healing or similar effects are applied to you. The long ages or questionable
    self-repair functions have hindered your functionality; pick one attribute
    and decrease its modifier by -1, to a minimum of -2.
