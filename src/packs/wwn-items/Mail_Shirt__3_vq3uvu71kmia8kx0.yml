  description: >-
    Mail shirts are usually of iron or steel wire, though bronze and other more
    exotic materials are not unknown. Such shirts cover only the vitals of the
    wearer, but are much less burdensome than a full hauberk. Medium armor is
    significantly noisier and more overt; it cannot be worn discreetly and
    applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any physical Sneak rolls made by the
    wearer.
