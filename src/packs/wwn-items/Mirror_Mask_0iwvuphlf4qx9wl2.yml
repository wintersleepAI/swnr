  description: >-
    You become instantly aware of any mind-affecting power directed at you and
    can identify the user if they're within your current sensory range. You may
    reroll any Mental saving throw the attacking ability allows you; if it
    doesn't allow a save, you get a single Mental save to resist anyway. If you
    succeed, you may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to give the
    power false information of your choice or a false impression of success.
