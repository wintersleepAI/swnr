  description: >-
    Duration: 12 turns Range: 180' A 15' radius area is rendered utterly silent.
    ▶ Within the area: All sound is stopped. Conversation and spell casting are
    impossible. ▶ Noise from outside the area: Can be heard by those within it.
    ▶ Casting upon a creature: Silence may be cast upon a creature, which must
    make a Mental save. If the save fails, the 15' radius area of silence moves
    with the creature. If the save succeeds, the spell's effect remains
    stationary&mdash;the targeted creature may move out of it.
