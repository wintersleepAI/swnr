    You've developed a refined aesthetic sense that can directly appeal to the
    subconscious beauty preferences of viewers. This shape improves your
    Charisma modifier by +1, to a maximum of +2. There is always something alien
    about this beauty, and such forms can never be mistaken for an entirely
    normal human or animal, though they may be taken for some exotic demihuman
    or altered baseline.
