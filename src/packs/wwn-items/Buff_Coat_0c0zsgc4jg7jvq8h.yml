  description: >-
    Buff coats are long coats of thick, supple hide, sometimes worn to cushion
    the bite of heavier armor and sometimes sported as ornamented street
    clothing for the gentry who can afford such luxuries Light armor may be
    decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer minimal
    hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also discreet enough
    to be worn politely in common society.
