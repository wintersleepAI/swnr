  description: >-
    A visible target creature and their possesions are briefly transformed into
    a misty, insubstantial cloud. Only sources of harm that could conceivably
    disrupt a cloud of mist can harm them, and until the spell's end they may
    pass freely into any area that a vapor could reach. They may move freely in
    all three dimensions at their normal movment rate, though they cannot
    physically manipulate objects. The spell lasts until the end of the scene or
    until the target or the caster choose to end it.
