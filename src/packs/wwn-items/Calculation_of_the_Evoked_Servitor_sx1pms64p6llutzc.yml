  description: >-
    This spell conjures up an intelligent familiar for the caster, one with one
    hit point per caster level, an AC of 14, a ground movement rate of 30' per
    action, saving throws the same as the caster, a +0 skill modifier, and no
    effective attack. The familiar always adopts the same shape for the same
    caster, though the initial casting can set this to any shape the caster
    wishes provided it's no larger than a small human. The familiar retains a
    telepathic connection with its creator and will obey any command it is
    given, including suicidal ones. It can perform any action that a competent
    human servant could. If the familiar is slain, it fades away, but can be
    called forth again by the spell. The familiar retains its memories of what
    happens while it's summoned, and can develop its own personality in time.
    The familiar remains in existence until dawn following the spell's casting
    or until dismissed by the caster.
