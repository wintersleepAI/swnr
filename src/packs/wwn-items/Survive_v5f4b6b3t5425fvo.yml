    Hunt, fish, navigate by the stars, mitigate environmental hazards, identify
    plants and wildlife, and craft basic survival tools and shelter. A PCâ€™s
    Survive skill is most pertinent to the environments in their background, but
    the basic principles can be applied in all but the most alien environments.
