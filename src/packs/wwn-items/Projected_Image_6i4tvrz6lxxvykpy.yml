  description: >-
    Duration: 6 turns Range: 240' An illusory duplicate of the caster appears
    within range. ▶ Duplicate: The image is an exact duplicate of the caster
    that can only be differentiated by touch. ▶ Subsequent spells cast: Appear
    to originate from the image. (Targets must still be visible to the caster,
    however.) ▶ Spells and missiles: The image appears unaffected by spells or
    missile weapons. ▶ Melee or touch: If the image is touched or hit in melee,
    it disappears.
