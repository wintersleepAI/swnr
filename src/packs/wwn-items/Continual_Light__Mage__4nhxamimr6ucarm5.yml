  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent Range: 120' This spell has three usages: Conjuring
    light: In a 30' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is
    not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which
    case the light moves with the object. Blinding a creature: By casting the
    spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it is blinded. A
    blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling darkness: Continual light may
    cancel a continual darkness spell (see below). Reversed: Continual Darkness
    Creates a 30' radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight
    and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of darkness do not
    illuminate it. Like continual light, it may alternatively be used to blind
    creatures or to dispel a continual light spell.
