  description: >-
    Large, strong, brutish, and comparatively stupid; such is the standard orc
    of fantasy campaigns. Players who want to play such a PC can use this Focus.
    Level 1: Gain Survive and Stab or Punch as bonus skills. Your Strength or
    Constitution modifier increases by +1, but your Intelligence modifier
    decreases by -1. You can see clearly in the dark out to sixty feet.
