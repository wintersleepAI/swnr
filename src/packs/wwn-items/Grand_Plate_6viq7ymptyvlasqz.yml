  description: >-
    Grand plate is so finely-jointed that a weapon must either be very large or
    very armor-piercing to harm the wearer; they're immune to non-magical melee
    or thrown weapons unless the weapon is two-handed, has a Shock rating of AC
    16 or more, or the wearer is currently grappled by someone as per the rules
    on page 43. This tight protection comes at the cost of the thick plating
    found in great armor or conventional plate. Heavy armor is the thickest,
    toughest panoply available on the market, and its bulk and noise make its
    encumbrance apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert checks made by the wearer.
