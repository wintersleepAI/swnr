    Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While Committed, you exude numerous
    tentacles or eldritch arms that can manipulate objects with your strength up
    to 20' away. You gain no bonus actions, but the arms can melee at range.
    These arms have your AC, and you are damaged if they are hurt.
