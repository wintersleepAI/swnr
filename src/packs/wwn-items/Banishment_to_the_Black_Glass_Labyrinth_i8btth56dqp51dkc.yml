  description: >-
    Aimed at a visible point within three hundred feet, the spell affects all
    creatures except the caster within a tenfoot radius of the target,
    translating them into a lightless extradimensional maze of endlessly tall
    obsidian walls. The maze is infinite, featureless, and empty. Transported
    creatures get a Mental saving throw to end the spell, re-appearing one round
    after it was cast. Those who fail their save get to make an additional
    attempt once an hour afterwards. Creatures with five or fewer hit dice
    cannot attempt these saving throws and are trapped forever unless the mage
    is killed or ends the spell. Time passes normally while trapped, and
    creatures snared within may rest, fight, or starve as their situation and
    wills so recommends. Dead or escaped creatures appear in the nearest clear
    space to their original departure.
