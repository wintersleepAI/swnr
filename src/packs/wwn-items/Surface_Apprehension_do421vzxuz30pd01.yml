  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action while targeting a visible
    living creature. If it fails a Mental saving throw, you become aware of its
    immediate surface thoughts for the rest of the round. If you ask specific
    questions of the creature during this round it will instinctively think of
    the answers, though the detail of these surface thoughts is generally
    limited to one or two sentences of information.
