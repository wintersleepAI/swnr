  description: >-
    You are a bodyguard, shieldbearer, or other gifted defender of others,
    accustomed to the roil of bloody battle and desperate struggle. Level 1:
    Gain Stab or Punch as a bonus skill. Gain a +2 on all skill checks for the
    Screen Ally combat action. You can screen against one more attacker per
    round than your skill would normally allow. Once per round, you can Screen
    Ally against even intangible spells or magical attacks or bodily shield them
    from an area-effect explosion or magic. Such attempts require the usual
    successful opposing skill check, with the assailant using their Magic skill.
    Level 2: The first Screen Ally skill check you make in a round is always
    successful. Gain +2 AC while screening someone. You can screen against foes
    as large as ogres or oxen.
