  description: >-
    Duration: Until quest is completed / Instant (remove quest) Range: 30' The
    caster commands a single subject to perform a specific quest or task. ▶
    Examples: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster, bringing a magic
    item to the caster, or going on a journey to a holy site. ▶ Suicidal quests:
    The prescribed quest must not be obviously suicidal. ▶ Saving throw: The
    subject may make a Mental save, with success indicating that the quest has
    no effect. ▶ Refusal: Otherwise, the subject must undertake the quest or
    fall under a curse (per the curse spell, with the exact nature of the curse
    determined by the referee). ▶ Completion: Once the task is completed, the
    spell ends. Reversed: Remove Quest Can dispel an active quest spell. If the
    character who cast the quest spell to be nullified is higher level than the
    character casting remove quest, there is a chance of the spell having no
    effect. The probability of failure is 5% per level the caster is below the
    caster of quest.
