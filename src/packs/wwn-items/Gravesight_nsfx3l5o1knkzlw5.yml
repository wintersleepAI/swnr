  description: >-
    Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while it remains Committed, you can see
    the life energies of living creatures around you as various glowing
    patterns, regardless of the mundane illumination available. You can perceive
    sicknesses, poisons, and other physical qualities on sight. As a side effect
    of this ability, you can see normally even in perfect blackness.
