  description: >-
    The caster sweeps away all unwanted magical effects and enchantments within
    a twenty-foot radius, centered on any visible point within one hundred feet
    per level. If the magical effect was cast by a creature with equal or fewer
    hit dice or levels, the effect is negated automatically. Otherwise, a
    contested Int/Magic or Cha/Magic skill roll must be made, with
    higher-leveled caster gaining a +2 bonus on their roll and the dispeller
    winning any ties. This spell is not strong enough to permanently suppress
    standing magical effects, and requires the aforementioned contested roll to
    have any chance to even temporarily suppressing them. If successful, the
    effect is negated for 1d6 rounds. If cast on a very large enchantment, only
    the portion within the spell's zone of effect is suppressed.
