  description: >-
    Duration: 12 turns Range: 60' The caster gains the ability to see through
    the eyes of other living creatures. ▶ Focus for 1 turn: To establish a
    connection with a creature, the caster must focus their concentration in one
    particular direction for one turn. ▶ After this turn: The visual perceptions
    of one creature within range in that direction are relayed to the caster. ▶
    Switching: Once a connection is established, the caster may choose to
    maintain it or to change to another subject. ▶ Obstructions: The spell is
    blocked by a thin layer of lead or by rock of 2' thick or greater.
