  description: >-
    A ball of soft, warm skin approximately four inches in diameter, the seed of
    flesh may be hurled at any surface within thirty feet as a Main Action. If
    flung with force, the seed transforms into a perfect duplicate of the
    creature that threw it, albeit naked and unequipped. It uses the user's
    attributes, skills, Foci, and other abilities, though it has only 6 hit
    points and it cannot cast spells or use arts. The duplicate will obey even
    suicidal commands and will remain active for up to a scene before shriveling
    back into a ball. It can be used only once per day. If it dies while active,
    the seed is destroyed.
