  description: >-
    You are a skilled poisoner, capable of compounding toxins out of
    readily-available flora and minerals. It takes an hour to brew a poison, and
    you can keep as many doses fresh as you have levels. Blade venoms take a
    Main Action to apply and last for ten minutes or until a hit or Shock is
    inflicted, whichever comes first. Detecting poisoned food is a Wis/Notice
    skill check against 10, or 12 if the diner's not a noble or otherwise
    normally wary of poison. One dose can poison up to a half-dozen diners.
    Level 1: Gain Heal as a bonus skill. Gain a reroll on any failed saving
    throw versus poison. Your toxins inflict 2d6 damage plus your level on a hit
    or Shock, with a Physical save for half. Your incapacitating or
    hallucinogenic toxins do the same, but those reduced to zero hit points are
    simply incapacitated for an hour. Level 2: You are immune to poison and can
    apply a universal antidote to any poisoned ally as a Main Action. Any
    attempt to detect or save against your poisons takes a penalty equal to your
    Heal skill. Your ingested poisons count as an Execution Attack against
    unsuspecting targets, as per page 44, with Heal used for the Physical saving
    throw penalty and 1d6 damage per level done on a success. Such poisons can
    be non-lethal at your discretion.
