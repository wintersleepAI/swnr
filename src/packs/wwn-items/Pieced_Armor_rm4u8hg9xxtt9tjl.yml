  description: >-
    Pieced armor is assembled of a thicker or more durable chestpiece and
    piecework limb armor. While less effective than a proper cuirass and
    greaves, it's often the best that scavengers or poor adventurers can get.
    Light armor may be decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to
    offer minimal hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also
    discreet enough to be worn politely in common society.
