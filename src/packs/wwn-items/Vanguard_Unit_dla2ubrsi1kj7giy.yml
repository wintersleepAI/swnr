  description: >-
    This unit is specially trained to build bridges, reduce fortifications, and
    facilitate a lightning strike into enemy territory. When its faction takes a
    Relocate Asset turn, it can move the Vanguard Unit and any allied units at
    the same location to any other location within range, even if the unit type
    would normally be prohibitive from moving there. Thus, a Force asset could
    be moved into a foreign nation's territory even against their wishes. The
    unit may remain at that location afterwards even if the Vanguard Unit
    leaves.
