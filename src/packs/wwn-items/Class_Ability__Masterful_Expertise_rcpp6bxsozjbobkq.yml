  description: >-
    Once per scene, the Expert may reroll any non-combat skill check as an
    Instant action. This allows the Expert to make a roll and then immediately
    use this ability if the resulting total isn't good enough to succeed. In
    cases where it matters, the better of the two rolls may be used.
