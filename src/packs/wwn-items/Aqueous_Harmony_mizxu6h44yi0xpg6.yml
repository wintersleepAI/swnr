  description: >-
    The elementalist and up to a dozen allies are charmed with powers of
    water-breathing, a tolerance for the pressure and cold of the deeps, and the
    ability to see through water as if it were well-lit air. Ensorceled beings
    may move freely while in the water at their usual movement rate and their
    attacks and projectile weapons are not hindered by the medium, nor are their
    possessions soaked or damaged. The spell lasts for one hour per caster
    level, but will not naturally end so long as a subject is still at least
    partially submerged. Only the caster or magical dispelling can stop it under
    those circumstances.
