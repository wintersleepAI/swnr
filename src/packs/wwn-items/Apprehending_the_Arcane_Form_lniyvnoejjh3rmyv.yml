  description: >-
    The mage opens up their mind to the presence of occult energies. For fifteen
    minutes per character level, they are capable of seeing active magical
    effects, curses, enchantments, or other dweomers as colored auras or
    patterns of light. They may identify magical items and get a one-sentence
    description of their purpose or most significant powers, and may get more
    sophisticated answers with successful Wis/Magic skill checks at difficulties
    of 8 or more depending on the subtlety of the enchantment. Mages with
    prepared spells are visible to the caster, though which spells the subject
    might have prepared is not knowable. As a side effect of this spell, the
    ambient thaumic currents cast enough quasi-light to allow the caster to see
    normally even in perfect darkness.
