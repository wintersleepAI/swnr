    You are able to translate examples of your favored weapon into a spiritual
    template that you may manifest as you wish. Any favored weapon can be turned
    into such a template, including a magical weapon, but the process destroys
    the object's physical form. To manifest a template, Commit Effort as an
    Instant action; a ghostly copy of the weapon appears Readied in hand for you
    until you release the Effort or stop touching the weapon. Dual-wielders can
    summon the same weapon into both hands with one use of this art.
