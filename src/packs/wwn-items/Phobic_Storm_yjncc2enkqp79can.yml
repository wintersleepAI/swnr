  description: >-
    A wave of numbing terror sweeps over all enemies of the caster within forty
    feet. They must immediately make a Morale check at a -1 penalty, with
    failure causing flight. Those who succeed at the check suffer one point of
    damage per caster level from demoralization and despair, with those brought
    to zero hit points instead regaining one hit point and fleeing. This spell
    has no effect on creatures that feel no fear or that have a Morale of 12.
