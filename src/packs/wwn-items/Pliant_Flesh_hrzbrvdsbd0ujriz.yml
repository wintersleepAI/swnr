    You've mastered your shapeshifting skills, and Change Form can be used as an
    On Turn action, albeit only once per round. Alternately, it can take as long
    as a minute but cost no Effort. Whenever you spend Effort to shift shape,
    you heal lost hit points equal to 1d6 plus your level; this does not apply
    when merely reverting a form's change. This art is intrinsic to you, and
    doesn't count against the total number of arts allowed to apply to a form.
