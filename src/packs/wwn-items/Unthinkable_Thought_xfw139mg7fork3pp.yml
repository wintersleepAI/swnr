  description: >-
    Target a visible living creature and Commit Effort for the day as a Main
    Action while specifying a particular person, object, or situation that is
    currently ongoing in their presence. The target may make a Mental save to
    resist; on a failure, they simply cannot consciously acknowledge the
    existence of the subject or its actions unless ignoring it would obviously
    put their life at risk. This forced ignorance lasts for up to a scene; at
    its end, the target will have no memory of the subject.
