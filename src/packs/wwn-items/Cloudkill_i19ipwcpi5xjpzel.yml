  description: >-
    Duration: 6 turns Range: 30' A poisonous fog streams from the caster's
    fingertips, filling a 30' diameter area. ▶ Movement: The fog moves at 60'
    per turn (20' per round), driven by the wind (or away from the caster, in
    still conditions). ▶ Sinking: Because the fog is heavier than air, it sinks
    to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings.
    ▶ Damage: All creatures in contact with the vapours suffer 1 hit point of
    damage per round of contact. ▶ Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice: Must
    also make a physical save (once per round of contact) or die.
