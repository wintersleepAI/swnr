  description: >-
    This spell calls forth a floating set of colored glass chimes. The caster
    alone may strike them, producing sounds of great subtlety and penetration.
    The caster may allow anyone in the desired range to hear the music, or may
    make it inaudible to anyone save specific targets within range. Such is the
    expressiveness of the chimes that those who hear them may instantly
    understand the caster's desired message, however abstract. If the caster
    strikes the chimes violently as a Main Action, they may shatter them,
    causing a deafening clamor that does 3d6 damage to all non-deaf targets
    within forty feet except for the caster. The maximum range of the chimes is
    ten miles per caster level, and they persist until shattered or the scene
    ends.
