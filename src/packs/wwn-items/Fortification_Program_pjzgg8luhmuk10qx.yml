    A program of organized fortification and supply caching has been undertaken
    around the Asset's location, hardening allied communities and friendly
    Assets. Once per turn, when an enemy makes an Attack that targets the
    faction's Force rating, the faction can use the Fortification Program to
    defend if the Asset is within a turn's move from the attack.
