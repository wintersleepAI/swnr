  description: >-
    This shape can exude a venom on its claws or fangs. Successful hits allow
    you to Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action to inflict an
    additional 1d8 damage plus your Survive skill. You can elect to make the
    toxin paralytic rather than fatal; foes reduced to zero hit points by such a
    blow are paralyzed and helpless for an hour rather than mortally wounded.
