  description: >-
    When this small censer is filled with flammable substances and lit as a Main
    Action, it exhales a thick, opaque white smoke. The bearer of the censer can
    mold the smoke with mental commands, shaping it into any solid, simple
    object that can fit in a thirty-foot cube. This object is opaque and
    requires 5 hit points of damage to punch a human-sized hole directly through
    it. Creatures caught inside the smoke can tear through it with a Main
    Action. It's sturdy enough to bear the weight of horses and it lasts for the
    remainder of the scene. The censer can be lit only once per day.
