  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target a visible creature.
    The creature must make a Physical save or become partially petrified, losing
    its Move action for a number of rounds equal to half your caster level,
    rounded up. Flying creatures are forced to land by this art and swimming
    creatures will inevitably sink to the bottom.
