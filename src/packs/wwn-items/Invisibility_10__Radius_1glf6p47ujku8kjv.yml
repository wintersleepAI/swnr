    Duration: Permanent (but may be broken, see below) Range: 120' A selected
    creature and all creatures within 10' of it become invisible: ▶ Area: The
    10' radius area of the spell's effect moves with the chosen creature. ▶
    Exiting the area: Subjects that move more than 10' away from the chosen
    creature become visible. ▶ Entering the area: Creatures that move into the
    area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. ▶ Gear: Any gear a
    subject is carrying is also rendered invisible. Items dropped or put down by
    an invisible creature become visible. Carried light sources become invisible
    but the emitted light does not. ▶ Breaking the invisibility: If a subject
    attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken for that subject.
