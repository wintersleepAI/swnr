  description: >-
    First practiced by the blind music masters of the Second Dynasty, this art
    gives you the equivalent of sight out to 60' even if blinded. You cannot
    distinguish colors, but you can perceive physical details as readily as if
    with your eyes. Physically-invisible creatures and objects are obvious to
    you.
