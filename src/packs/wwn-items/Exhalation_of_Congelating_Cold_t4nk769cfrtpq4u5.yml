  description: >-
    The caster invokes a gust of deepest winter on a point within one hundred
    feet per level, freezing everything in a radius up to ten feet per caster
    level. All liquids freeze solid down to a depth of two feet and all living
    creatures not impervious to arctic cold must suffer 1d6 damage per two
    levels of the caster, with a Physical save for half damage. Those who fail
    their Physical saves are numbed by the cold and lose their Move action each
    round for the next [[/roll 1d4]] rounds. The frozen area warms again at the
    usual rate for the surrounding environment.
