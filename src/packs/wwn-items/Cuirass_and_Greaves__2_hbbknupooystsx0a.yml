  description: >-
    Cuirass and greave armor reflects those different designs that rely on solid
    metal plating over the wearer's vitals along with lighter limb armor. Medium
    armor is significantly noisier and more overt; it cannot be worn discreetly
    and applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any physical Sneak rolls made by
    the wearer.
