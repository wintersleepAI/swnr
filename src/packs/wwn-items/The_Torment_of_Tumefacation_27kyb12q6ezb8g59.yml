  description: >-
    A single visible living creature is smote with a hideous curse of torment.
    Boils erupt all over their body, blood weeps from their orifices, tumors
    engorge their flesh, and all of their hair falls out almost instantaneously.
    If they perform any vigorous physical action save defending themselves they
    incur two points of damage per caster level from the effects of the curse,
    damage which can be suffered no more than once per round by a target. A
    creature may spend its Main Action to attempt a Physical save to throw off
    the curse and return to a glabrous normalcy, but on a failure, the curse
    remains for the rest of the scene. If the creature has fewer hit dice than
    the caster has levels, a single failed save means the curse lasts
    indefinitely, until dispelled or the caster releases them.
