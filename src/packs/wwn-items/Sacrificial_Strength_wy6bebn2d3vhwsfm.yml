    When imbibed, the user is capable of channeling their own life force into
    the damage they do. One time within the next scene, as an Instant action,
    they may sacrifice a number of hit points of their choice when they inflict
    damage on a target. For every four HP sacrificed, the damage done is
    increased by 1d6, up to a maximum of 5d6. The user must retain at least one
    hit point, and the bonus damage can be applied to only one target of a
    damaging action.
