  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target a visible creature
    within fifty feet per caster level. The target creature must be wearing or
    holding at least a pound worth of conductive metal or be considerably
    dampened. An electrical bolt leaps from the caster to stun the target,
    causing them to lose their next Main Action. A Physical saving throw can
    mitigate the effect, causing the target to lose their Move action instead of
    their Main. A creature can be targeted only once per scene by this.
