  description: >-
    A necromancer can give an undead creature the semblence of a healthy, normal
    living being with this spell. The target appears as it did in life, at any
    point in its lifespan that the necromancer so desires, and is capable of
    performing all normal human activities that its cognition allows it to
    perform. The spell uses the creature's nature as a template for its effects,
    so the disguise is tangible and physically real until dispelled or the
    necromancer drops the effect. A necromancer can maintain only one such
    disguise per level, and it does not work on sentient unwilling targets.
