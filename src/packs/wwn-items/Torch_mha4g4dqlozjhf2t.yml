  description: >-
    A lantern or torch casts usable light in a thirty-foot radius. Objects
    outside this range are too indistinct to be made out in the typical stygian
    gloom of a Deep. A torch lasts for 6 turns (1 hour) before burning out. This
    item can be bundled in units of three for the same encumbrance, with a Main
    Action to break open a bundle to get at the contents.
