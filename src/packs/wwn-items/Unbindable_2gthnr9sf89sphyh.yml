  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action whenever you wish to escape
    chains, grapples, shackles, ropes, or even a magical spell of physical
    binding. You automatically wriggle free from mundane restraints and gain an
    Evasion saving throw to instantly end a physical magical binding of some
    sort. You can use this art only once per round.
