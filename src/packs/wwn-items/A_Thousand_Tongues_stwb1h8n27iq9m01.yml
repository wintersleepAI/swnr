  description: >-
    Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while it remains Committed, you can
    speak with and understand any sentient creature with a language of their
    own. To any listener, it will seem as if you are perfectly fluent in their
    own language, even as you speak in your own native tongue. This ability does
    not allow you to read or write unknown languages.
