  description: >-
    Some sublimely cunning mastermind ensures that the schemes of this faction
    are unimaginably subtle and far-seeing. Whenever the faction's Assets make a
    roll involving Cunning, they may reroll a failed check at the cost of
    inflicting 1d6 damage on Just As Planned. This may be done repeatedly,
    though it may destroy the Asset. There is no range limit on this benefit.
