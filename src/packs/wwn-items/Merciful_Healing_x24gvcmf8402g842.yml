    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and touch a target within melee
    range. The target receives 1d6+2 points of magical healing. If done in
    combat or used to revive a Mortally Wounded subject, the rushed haste of the
    healing adds 1 System Strain to the target, but no System Strain is added if
    it is applied outside of combat. At fourth level the healing done increases
    to 2d6+4 and at eighth level it becomes 4d6+8.
