  description: >-
    You have a striking ability to charm and pacify people and creatures you've
    just met. Once they get to know you, however, their opinions are more likely
    to be based on experience; this Focus works only once on a target. Level 1:
    Reaction rolls made by those the party meets are given a +1 bonus so long as
    you are present, whether or not you do the talking. Even hostile encountered
    beings will usually give the party a round to parley before attacking unless
    they're in ambush or have a clear reason for immediate violence. Level 2:
    Once per game session, when a reaction roll is made, cause the subject to be
    as friendly and helpful to you and your party as it's plausibly possible for
    them to be. It's up to the GM to decide why the creature becomes so; it
    might be mistaken about your nature, or find you hilarious, or perhaps want
    a favor from you and your allies.
