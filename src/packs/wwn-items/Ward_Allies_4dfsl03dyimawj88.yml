  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to omit up to six allies from
    the effects of an area-effect spell you cast, allowing them to avoid any
    damage or other negative effect that would be directly produced by the
    spell. This does not protect them from indirect consequences, however, such
    as destroying the building they are standing in.
