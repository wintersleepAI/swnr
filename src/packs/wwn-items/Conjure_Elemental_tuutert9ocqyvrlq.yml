    elemental&mdash;a being formed of pure elemental matter&mdash;is summoned
    from an elemental plane of the caster's choice (air, earth, fire, water) to
    do the caster's bidding. ▶ Materials: The summons requires a large volume of
    the appropriate element. ▶ Concentration: Is required to command an
    elemental. ▶ Dismissing: While control over the elemental is maintained, the
    caster may dismiss it at any time, sending it back to its plane of origin. ▶
    Disruption: If the caster moves at more than half speed or their
    concentration is disturbed, the command over the elemental ends. It is,
    henceforth, a freewilled entity and will immediately try to kill the caster
    and any who get in its way. ▶ Dispelling: A conjured elemental may be
    dispelled by dispel magic or dispel evil. Restrictions: The caster may
    summon at most one elemental from each plane in a single day. Air Elemental
