  description: >-
    The caster molds the soil and stone of the land around them, raising hills,
    digging trenches, or forming simple structures out of extruded bedrock. Once
    cast, the mage may psychically mold the terrain within three hundred feet
    per caster level, shifting it slowly over the course of an hour to form
    whatever shape they desire out of it, provided the material used can
    actually maintain such a shape. Simple buildings and walls may be created
    out of bedrock or available stone, and tunnels and caves may be shaped up to
    50 feet down from the caster, while hills may be raised up to 200 feet above
    the prevailing grade. This spell cannot work within a thousand feet of stone
    or earth that has been significantly worked by intelligent creatures, though
    the use of this spell by the same caster doesn't count as working the earth
    on further castings.
