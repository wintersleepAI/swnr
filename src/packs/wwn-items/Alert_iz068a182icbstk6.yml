  description: >-
    You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take
    unaware. Level 1: Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be surprised, nor
    can others use the Execution Attack option on you. If the GM rolls
    initiative by sides, you can add a +1 bonus to your side's initiative roll,
    though multiple Alert PCs don't stack this bonus. If you roll initiative
    individually, you can roll it twice and take the better result. Level 2: You
    always act first in a combat round unless someone else involved is also this
    Alert.
