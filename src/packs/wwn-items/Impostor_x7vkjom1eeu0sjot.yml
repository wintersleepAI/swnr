  description: >-
    You are exceedingly skilled at presenting yourself as something you are not,
    including disguises, voice mimicry, and lightning-fast wardrobe changes.
    Some impostors rely on the acting skills of Perform, while others lean more
    to the nefarious tricks of Sneak. Level 1: Gain Perform or Sneak as a bonus
    skill. Once per scene, reroll any failed skill check or saving throw related
    to maintaining an imposture or disguise. Create one false identity of no
    great social importance; you can flawlessly pretend to be that person, such
    that only extremely persuasive proof can connect you with it. You can change
    this identity with a week's worth of effort in building a new one. Level 2:
    You can alter your clothing and armor such that a single Main Action lets
    you swap between any of three chosen appearances. In addition to your
    original false identity, you can establish a new false identity in each city
    or significant community you spend at least a week in.
