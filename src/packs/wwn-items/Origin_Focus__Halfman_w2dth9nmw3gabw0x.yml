  description: >-
    You have been separated from your herd. Your intellect has achieved human
    levels in the time since, and for whatever reason you no longer seek to
    return to them. Level 1: Gain Survive as a bonus skill. Your Constitution
    modifier increases by +1, up to a +2 maximum. You are immune to natural
    extremes of heat and cold, and can digest any plant matter a normal ruminant
    could. Your isolation from the herd inflicts a -2 penalty on all Mental
    saving throws, however.
