  description: >-
    Your blood is not like the blood of normal beings. Predators find it
    nauseating and will not bite you unless provoked. Unintelligent predators
    will not consider you edible. This ichor is reluctant to leave your body,
    and stabbing or puncture injuries can Mortally Wound you but cannot result
    in your death unless you are entirely pincushioned by your foes or suffer
    catastrophic physical damage.
