  description: >-
    Something about your hero interferes with easy use of magic on them. It may
    be a strangely powerful birth blessing, a particular supernatural bloodline,
    or simple occult incompatibility. This Focus cannot be taken by Mages or
    Partial Mages. Level 1: You and all allies within twenty feet gain a +2
    bonus to all saving throws against magical effects. As an On Turn action,
    you can feel the presence or use of magic within twenty feet of you, though
    you can't discern details about it or the specific source. The first failed
    saving throw against a magical effect you suffer in a day is turned into a
    success. Level 2: Once per day, as an Instant action, you are simply not
    affected by an unwanted magical effect or supernatural monstrous ability,
    even if it wouldn't normally allow a saving throw. Immunity to a persistent
    effect lasts for the rest of the scene.
