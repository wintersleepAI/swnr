  description: >-
    Linothorax armor is a stiffer armor of glued, layered cloth, often as
    elaborately decorated as the arts of its maker allow. Light armor may be
    decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer minimal
    hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also discreet enough
    to be worn politely in common society.
