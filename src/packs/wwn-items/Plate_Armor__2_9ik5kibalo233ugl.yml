  description: >-
    Plate armor is an extremely expensive suit of tailored metal pieces that
    cover both the vitals and the limbs of the wearer. Heavy armor is the
    thickest, toughest panoply available on the market, and its bulk and noise
    make its encumbrance apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert checks made by the
    wearer.
