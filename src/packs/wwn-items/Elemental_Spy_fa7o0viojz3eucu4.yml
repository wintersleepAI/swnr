  description: >-
    The elementalist enchants a stone, ounce of liquid, flame no smaller than a
    candleflame, or a particular plume of smoke or incense. For one day per
    level, so long as the charmed object is not destroyed, dispersed, or
    consumed, they can as a Main Action see and listen to anything around the
    object as if they were standing there.
