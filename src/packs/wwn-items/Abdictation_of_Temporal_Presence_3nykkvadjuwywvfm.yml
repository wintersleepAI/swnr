  description: >-
    The caster and up to one visible ally per caster level briefly step outside
    of the conventional flow of time, the rest of the world freezing around
    them. These subjects can take 1d4+1 free rounds of actions, but they cannot
    physically affect the world or move any object they were not carrying at the
    time they cast the spell. Any spells the caster or other allies cast can
    affect only their own group, and not those entities still in the normal flow
    of time.
