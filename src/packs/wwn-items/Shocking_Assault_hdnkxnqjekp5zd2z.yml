  description: >-
    You're extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your melee
    attacks stresses and distracts enemies even when your blows don't draw
    blood. Level 1: Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock damage of
    your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10, assuming your weapon
    is capable of harming the target in the first place and the target is not
    immune to Shock. Level 2: In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock
    damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed attacks. As usual, regular
    hits never do less damage than this Shock would do on a miss.
