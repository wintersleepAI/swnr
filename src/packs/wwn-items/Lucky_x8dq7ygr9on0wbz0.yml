  description: >-
    Some fund of remarkable luck has preserved your life at least once in the
    past, and continues to give you an edge in otherwise hopeless situations.
    This luck does not favor the already-blessed; this Focus can only be taken
    by a PC with at least one attribute modifier of -1 or less. Level 1: Once
    per week, a blow or effect that would otherwise have left you killed,
    mortally wounded, or rendered helpless somehow fails to connect or affect
    you. You make any rolls related to games of chance twice, taking the better
    roll. Level 2: Once per session, in a situation of need or peril, you can
    trust to your luck and roll 1d6. On a 2 or more, something fortunate will
    happen to further your goal, provide an escape from immediate peril, or
    otherwise give you an advantage you need, if not immediate victory. On a 1,
    the situation will immediately grow much worse, as the GM sees fit.
