  description: >-
    Appearing as a glove, gauntlet, or set of matching rings, an Implacable Fist
    grants its user an inhuman grip strength to the hand that wears it. With a
    full round to build up its force, it can crush or destroy any mundane
    material it grips. Magical materials force a Str/Exert skill check against a
    difficulty of 8 or more to be vulnerable to the fist's effects. The time
    necessary to focus the strength makes it impractical to use as a weapon in
    combat or grappling, but if the wearer somehow can get a hand on a helpless
    or completely restrained target, the grip will destroy any limb it grasps or
    kill a target whose head or viscera are crushed. The Fist can be used at
    will, but any object carried in that hand has a 1 in 6 chance of being
    destroyed accidentally by the wearer's reaction to combat or other sudden
    stress.
