  description: >-
    These bottles are always extremely cold and relatively fragile; even
    loosening the stopper provokes a warning twinge of ice in the air around it.
    When opened or shattered, every water-based liquid within twenty feet is
    instantly flash-frozen at least a foot deep, all fires are extinguished in
    that range, and living creatures take 2d6 damage. Against liquid or fiery
    creatures this damage is maximized.
