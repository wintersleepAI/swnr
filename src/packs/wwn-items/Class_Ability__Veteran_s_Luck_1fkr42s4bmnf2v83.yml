  description: >-
    Once per scene, as an Instant action, the Warrior may turn a missed attack
    they have made into a hit. Alternately, they may turn a successful attack
    against them into a miss, also as an Instant action. This ability is
    particularly lethal when used with the Make a Snap Attack action and leveled
    against weaker monsters or ordinary human warriors, as explained on page 44.
    Only one exercise of this ability is possible in a scene, either to force a
    miss or ensure a hit on a foe; both options may not be employed in the same
    fight. A Warrior may use this ability with crew-served weapons they are
    assisting in firing. This ability cannot be used to negate environmental
    damage or damage done to a vehicle or mount they are riding.
