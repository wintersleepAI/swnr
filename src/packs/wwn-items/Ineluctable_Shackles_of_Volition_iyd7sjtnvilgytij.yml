  description: >-
    The mage targets a visible living creature within 100 feet. The subject must
    immediately make a Mental saving throw at a penalty equal to the caster's
    Magic skill or become enthralled to the caster's will. Such victims will
    obey any physical commands issued by the caster, barring ones that seem
    suicidal or patently meant to result in their murder. The caster cannot
    order the creature to answer questions or perform acts that require
    independent judgment, nor to use non-physical abilities or spells, but it
    will fight for the caster or to defend its own life. Enchanted victims
    appear torpid and dazed, and will act only to defend themselves or satisfy
    their needs. The spell lasts until dispelled, or until the caster dies or
    releases them. Every time this spell is cast, however, all prior subjects
    get an immediate unmodified Mental saving throw to throw it off. If the
    creature has more hit dice than the caster, it gets an unmodified saving
    throw to end the effect the first time each day it's ordered to do something
    it finds strongly objectionable.
