    Commit Effort as an On Turn action to conjure an elemental barrier around
    yourself. The barrier improves your Armor Class by +4 and remains as long as
    the Effort remains Committed. This bonus stacks with other effects, but
    cannot increase AC above 18, regardless of the combinations.
