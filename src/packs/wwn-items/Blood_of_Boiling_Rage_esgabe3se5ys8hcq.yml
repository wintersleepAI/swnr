  description: >-
    The imbiber of this brew is suffused with a berserk fury. For the rest of
    the scene, or until the potion's effect is ended, they can roll their attack
    and damage rolls twice, taking the better result. Every round, however, they
    must either attack someone physically or try to reach them in order to
    attack them. If all foes are downed, allies will be targeted next. If the
    berserker is left alone or wishes to end the rage prematurely, they must
    spend a Main Action fighting the fury and make a Mental saving throw to end
    it. On a failure, they must spend their next round raging before they can
    try again. Berserk subjects have enough presence of mind to use special
    abilities or do complicated actions in order to kill or reach a target, but
    they cannot cast spells.
