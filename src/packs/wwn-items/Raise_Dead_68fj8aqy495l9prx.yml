  description: >-
    Duration: Instant Range: 120' This spell has two uses: 1. Restore life: To a
    recently deceased human or demihuman. See below. 2. Destroy undead: A single
    undead monster is destroyed, if it fails a Physical save. Restoring life:
    When used to restore life, the following stipulations apply: ▶ Time limit:
    The caster can raise a person that has been dead for no longer than four
    days per level of the caster above 7th. For example, a 10th level caster can
    revive a character that has been dead for twelve days (three levels above
    7th &times; four days). ▶ Weakness: Returning from death is an ordeal. Until
    the subject gets two full weeks of bed rest, they are fragile, move at half
    the normal rate, cannot carry heavy items, and cannot attack, cast spells,
    or use other class abilities. This period of weakness may not be shortened
    by any magical healing. Reversed: Finger of Death Directs a ray of deadly
    magic at a single target. If the target fails a Physical save, it dies
    instantly. Casting finger of death is a chaotic act; it will only be used by
    lawful casters in desperate situations.
