  description: >-
    These devices are always found in groups of 1d4+2 pegs, each one appearing
    to be a glyphed metal rod perhaps a foot in length with a chisel-shaped
    point on one end. If thrust firmly into a stone or earthen surface, the peg
    will effortlessly sink into the material and become as firm and fixed as if
    it were cemented in place. The peg can only be freely removed by the person
    who sank it into place, otherwise requiring that it be chiseled out with a
    scene's effort and the correct tools.
