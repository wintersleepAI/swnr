  description: >-
    This small bag contains a never-ending supply of spiritually-purifying salt.
    If the salt is used to dust an object or weapon as a Main Action, that
    object can interact with incorporeal entities or spirits as if they were
    solid for the rest of the scene. If hurled directly at a creature from melee
    distance, it does 3d6 damage to incorporeal beings, mages, or unnatural
    magical creatures. If actually consumed by a sentient creature, it fills the
    imbiber with a sense of guilt and acute sorrow, inflicting 3d6 emotional
    damage. Creatures reduced to zero hit points regain one point but will
    attempt suicide. One pinch of salt can be taken from the bag each scene.
