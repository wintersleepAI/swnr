  description: >-
    This spell can only be applied to a helpless or restrained living victim,
    who gets a Mental saving throw to resist it and be ever after immune to its
    effects. On a failure, the target becomes hopelessly subject to the caster
    via a series of psychic fetters, obediently carrying out their will. The
    target must be able to understand the caster's wishes, but will obey them to
    the best of its intelligence, capability, and initiative. They must make a
    Mental saving throw to resist performing even suicidal acts. The spell lasts
    until it is dispelled or the caster releases the target. A caster can have
    no more creatures under this spell than twice their level or hit dice; if
    this number is exceeded, the earliest thrall is freed first.
  duration: Until dispelled or released
