  description: >-
    Duration: 12 turns Range: 60' This spell grants the caster the ability to
    perceive and understand the thoughts of other living creatures, provided
    they fail a Mental save. ▶ Focus for 1 turn: To pick up thoughts, the caster
    must focus their concentration in one direction for one turn. ▶ After this
    turn: The thoughts of all creatures within range in that direction can be
    perceived. ▶ Multiple creatures: If multiple creatures are within the range
    in the direction being focused on, their thoughts mingle into a confusing
    jumble. The caster must spend an additional turn to sort out one creature's
    thoughts. ▶ Meaning: The caster understands the meaning of all thoughts even
    if they do not share the creature's language. ▶ Obstructions: The ability to
    perceive thoughts is obstructed by a thin layer of lead or by rock of 2'
    thick or greater.
