  description: >-
    Duration: 12 turns Range: 120' This spell has three usages: Conjuring light:
    In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as
    bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case the
    light moves with the object. Blinding a creature: By casting the spell upon
    its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it is blinded for the
    duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling darkness: Light may
    cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed: Darkness Creates a 15' radius
    area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision).
    Like light, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a
    light spell.
