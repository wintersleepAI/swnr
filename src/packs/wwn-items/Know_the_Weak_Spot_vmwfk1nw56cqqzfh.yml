  description: >-
    Whenever inflicting damage on a beast with a weapon or physical attack, roll
    the damage twice and take the higher score. Optionally, Commit Effort for
    the scene as an Instant action when an ally within earshot hits a beast;
    your shouted advice or distracting help allows them to roll damage twice and
    take the better result as well.
