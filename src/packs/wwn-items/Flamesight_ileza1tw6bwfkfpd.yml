    Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the Effort remains Committed, you
    can see thermal gradients sufficient to distinguish surfaces and living
    creatures, even in perfect darkness. Optionally, you may cause your own eyes
    to cast a light sufficient to illuminate your surroundings clearly out to a
    range of 30 feet.
