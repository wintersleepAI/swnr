  description: >-
    The elementalist calls up a deep, rolling tremor from within the earth,
    centering it on a visible point and affecting all structures in a radius of
    up to five hundred feet. This spell's effects are slow, requiring five
    minutes to fully manifest, but they can successfully topple or destroy any
    structures, tunnels, or caves within the affected area unless such
    structures are magically reinforced. The effects are negated if the spell is
    dispelled before it fully manifests.
