  description: >-
    An improvement to the Far Speech art, you may now nominate up to a
    half-dozen companions to be favored targets for Far Speech. You may link
    with a favored target as an On Turn action without Committing Effort. The
    range to contact a favored target is one mile per Thought Noble level. You
    can change your nominated companions with an hour's meditation in the new
    companion's presence.
