  description: >-
    As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day and target a visible sentient
    creature. It gets a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, any thought
    of you or your actions is suffused by a glow of benign happiness and
    admiration. They will treat you as an admired friend and find all your
    actions to be eminently reasonable and wise until you or your allies attack
    them, bring harm to something they love, or leave their presence for more
    than an hour. Affected creatures that were not misused are unlikely to think
    themselves bespelled when this power ends unless given reason to. This
    ability can affect only one target at a time.
