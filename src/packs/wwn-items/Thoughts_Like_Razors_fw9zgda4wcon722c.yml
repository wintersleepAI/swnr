  description: >-
    As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day to launch a psychic assault on
    any visible living creature within sixty feet. The target gets a Mental
    saving throw to resist; on a failure, it takes 1d8 damage per level of the
    Thought Noble. The damage can knock it unconscious but cannot kill. On a
    successful save, the Thought Noble is stunned by the backlash, taking one
    quarter of the damage, rounded down, and losing their next turn's actions.
    This ability can be used only once per scene.
