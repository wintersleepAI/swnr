  description: >-
    These palm-sized lenses collect and concentrate light into a beam of lethal
    jewel-colored radiance. If used in direct sunlight, the beam so created does
    5d6 damage to a single target within 300 feet, with an Evasion save to
    negate the damage. If used indoors in ordinary lighting, the effect does
    3d6, and if the chamber is dark save for torches or other portable light
    sources the damage is a mere 1d6. If the lens is used more than once per
    day, there is a 1 in 4 chance it shatters after each subsequent bolt.
