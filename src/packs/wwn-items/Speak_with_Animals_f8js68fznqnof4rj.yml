  description: >-
    Duration: 6 turns Range: 30' The caster can communicate with one type of
    animal within range when the spell is cast. ▶ Type of animal: Ordinary
    animals or giant versions of ordinary animals may be targeted. ▶ Questions:
    The caster can ask questions of and receive answers from animals of the
    chosen kind, although the spell doesn't make animals any more friendly or
    cooperative than normal (a reaction roll may be required). ▶ Services: If an
    animal is friendly toward the caster, it may perform some favour or service.
