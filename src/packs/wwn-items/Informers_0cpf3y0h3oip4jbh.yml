    As a free action, once per turn, the faction can spend 1 Treasure and have
    the Informers look for Stealthed Assets. To do so, the Informers pick a
    faction and make a Cunning vs. Cunning Attack on them. No counterattack
    damage is taken if they fail, but if they succeed, all Stealthed Assets of
    that faction within one move of the Informers are revealed.
