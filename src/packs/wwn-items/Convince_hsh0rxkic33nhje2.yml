  description: >-
    Persuade a listener that something you are saying is true. Naturally, the
    more implausible the claim or more emotionally repugnant it is to them, the
    more difficult it is to persuade them. Furthermore, how they act on their
    newfound conviction is up to them and their motivations, and may not be
    perfectly predictable.
