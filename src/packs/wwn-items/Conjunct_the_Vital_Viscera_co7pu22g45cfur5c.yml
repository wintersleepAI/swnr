  description: >-
    The caster renders the forms and life energy of up to one willing subject
    per caster level into something plastic and transferrable. Hit points,
    poisons, and diseases can be transferred from one creature to another, if
    both are willing or helplessly bound, healing up to the maximum allowed hit
    points of the target creature. Body parts can be exchanged or gifted so long
    as each subject retains at least half of their original corpus. A willing
    target can even be absorbed into the body of another subject of the spell,
    disappearing into them until the spell ends or they choose to spring back
    out, fully-equipped. Assimilated subjects can continue to see and hear what
    goes on outside their carrier. A given subject can absorb up to five other
    human-sized targets. The spell lasts until dispelled, released, or one hour
    per caster level has passed, though transferred hit points or afflictions do
    not return to their original subject. If a subject is killed while
    "borrowing" another's body parts, those parts do not return
