  description: >-
    Often a pale blue powder meant to be inhaled, this dust allows the user to
    explore the immediate future. Their next fifteen minutes will play out in
    their visions, their actions chosen as they wish and their most probable
    consequences made evident in the dreamlike fugue, assuming those
    consequences are evident within the next fifteen minutes. While under the
    dust's effects the subject is oblivious to the mundane world.
