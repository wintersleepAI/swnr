  description: >-
    The creature that imbibes this fluid can exhale it again as a Main Action to
    do 4d6 damage plus their character level to all targets within a cone thirty
    feet long and wide. Victims can make an Evasion saving throw to halve the
    damage. Different fluids produce different noxious exhalations, though
    flame, frost, poison, and lethal radiation are not uncommon finds. Only one
    breath attack is allowed, and if not made within a scene the potion is
    wasted.
