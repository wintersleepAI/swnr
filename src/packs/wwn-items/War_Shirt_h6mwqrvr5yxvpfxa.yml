  description: >-
    War shirts are nothing more than blessed shirts, lucky cloaks, auspicious
    warpaint, or whatever tokens of martial victory are favored by the poor and
    humble of a given culture. While they may look like nothing but normal
    clothing, their war-luck is still sufficient to interfere with a
    spellcaster's abilities should they try to wear one. Light armor may be
    decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer minimal
    hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also discreet enough
    to be worn politely in common society.
