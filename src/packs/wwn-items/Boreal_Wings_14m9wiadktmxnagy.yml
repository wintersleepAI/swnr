  description: >-
    The elementalist chooses a visible ally within one hundred feet; the target
    becomes capable of swift and easy aerial travel, flying at twice their usual
    movement rate. If the spell ends or is dispelled while aloft, the target
    descends gently to the earth. This spell lasts for one scene, though casters
    of fifth level or more can make it last an hour, and those of eighth level
    or more can make it last until dawn or dusk, whichever comes next.
