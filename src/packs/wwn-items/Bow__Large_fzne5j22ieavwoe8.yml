  description: >-
    Bows cover everything from the small self bows of horse archers to the
    man-tall longbows wielded by foot archers. Larger bows are more cumbersome
    and impossible to shoot from horseback, but usually have superior strength.
    An archer with a Readied quiver can load a fresh arrow as a Move action each
    turn, or as an On Turn action if they have at least Shoot-1 skill.
