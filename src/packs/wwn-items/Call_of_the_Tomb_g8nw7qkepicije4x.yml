  description: >-
    The necromancer invokes the inescapable urge for self-dissolution within the
    substance of all that exists, amplifying the weight of their own mortality.
    All enemy creatures within forty feet are affected. Targets can make a
    Mental saving throw to resist, in which case the effects last only one
    round, otherwise lasting for one round per caster level. During this time
    all attacks made against the victims automatically hit and all damage dice
    they suffer are maximized. Any special defenses they may have against
    mundane weapons or certain types of injury are negated while the spell is on
    them.
