  description: >-
    A pool of water, mirror, open flame, polished crystal, or other luminous or
    reflective surface is used to peer at a distant location. The location must
    either be within one hundred feet per caster level or be a location the
    caster has physically occupied before. The caster perceives the location as
    if he were standing at the targeted point within it, seeing and hearing
    events there as if he were present. This spell cannot scry locations that
    have been magically warded, and scrying the same location repeatedly is
    hindered by the resonance created by the spell. The spell cannot perceive
    the same area twice within the same week, or position its target point so as
    to overlap a prior area with its perceptions within that time. If a target
    present in the area has more hit dice than the caster has levels, they get a
    Mental saving throw to get an uncanny sense of being watched, something that
    will alert those cognizant of this spell. This spell lasts until the caster
    performs some action other than focusing on the scrying.
