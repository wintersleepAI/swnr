  description: >-
    A blinding fan of impossible colors cascades over all targets in front of
    the caster in an area equal to a cone a hundred feet long and a hundred feet
    wide at the end. Each creature within that area must make a Physical saving
    throw; those who fail roll 1d6. On a 1, they are unharmed, on a 2 they
    collapse into a handful of dust, on a 3 they fall unconscious for an hour,
    on a 4 they go violently insane for the next hour and attack all around
    them, on a 5 they turn to stone, and on a 6 they become utterly enthralled
    to the caster's commands for the next hour, as if under the effect of an
    @UUID[Compendium.wwn.arts.Item.om8rt7ZXQBNhonbg]{Ineluctable Shackles of
    Volition} spell.
