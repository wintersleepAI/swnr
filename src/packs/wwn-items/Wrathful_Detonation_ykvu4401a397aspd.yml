  description: >-
    These flasks are always permanently sealed. When intentionally hurled at a
    location, they detonate to do 2d6 damage to all targets within 15'. The
    magic in the flasks ensures that they always hit the targeted point,
    provided it's within 60'. Accidental breakage or breakage by an object is
    insufficient to trigger the magic, which requires human volition to catalyze
    it. Only one flask can be hurled at a time or the first to detonate will
    ruin the rest.
