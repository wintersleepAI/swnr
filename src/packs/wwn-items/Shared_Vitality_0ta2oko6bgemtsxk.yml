  description: >-
    The animal companions you bind have hit dice no lower than your level, even
    if they normally have far fewer. Thus, a 2 hit die beast bound by a 7th
    level Beastmaster would have 7 hit dice while it remained bound. Its hit
    bonus can't be less than half its hit dice, rounded up. A Beastmaster can
    stabilize a Mortally Wounded companion by Committing Effort for the scene as
    an Instant action.
