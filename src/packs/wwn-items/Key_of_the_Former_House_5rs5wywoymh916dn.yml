  description: >-
    A stylized key, this item may be used as a Main Action to create a
    shimmering doorway into a prior period of time in which there was an
    uninhabited domicile in the current location. Those who pass through the
    doorway enter into this place and time; if they move more than thirty feet
    away from the other side of the doorway, they're immediately ejected back
    into the present. The doorway in the present day continues to glow for five
    minutes after the key is triggered before fading to invisibility, though it
    can still be passed through from either side. The house on the other side of
    the doorway is abandoned or empty; it may look more or less normal, but
    there's a 1 in 6 chance each time this key is used that there is something
    dangerous there, a toxic environment, or some other hazard. The key may be
    used once per day, with the doorway lasting up to twenty-four hours before
    ejecting any remaining interlopers and closing. Each time the doorway
    closes, there's a 1 in 6 chance the key shatters.
