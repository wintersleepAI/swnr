  description: >-
    The spell may be triggered as an Instant action by the caster, imparting a
    burst of unquenchable life force to all allied creatures within 50 feet. For
    the next five rounds, no affected ally can be reduced below 1 hit point,
    regardless of the damage inflicted upon them. At the end of the spell's
    effect, the caster's own life energy is exhausted, leaving them with only 1
    hit point. A creature can benefit from this spell no more than once per day.
