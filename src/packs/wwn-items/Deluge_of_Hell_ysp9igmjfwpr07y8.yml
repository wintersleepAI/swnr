  description: >-
    The caster unleashes a consuming destruction on a visible point within three
    thousand feet. A torrent of eldritch ruin rains down from the heavens on
    everything within up to a two hundred foot radius per caster level,
    inflicting 1d8 damage per caster level with a Physical save for half damage,
    and automatically killing all targets with 4 or fewer hit dice. This damage
    is sufficient to destroy any wooden or lightly-built stone structure and
    will seriously damage even fortifications. The caster can tighten the radius
    down to a minimum of 20 feet, but cannot be selective about targets within
    that area, This spell cannot be cast indoors, and is extremely hazardous to
    the caster; they must make a Mental saving throw on casting it or suffer a
    quarter of the damage inflicted, rounded up.
