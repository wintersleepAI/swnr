  description: >-
    A visible willing creature within thirty feet is surrounded by a whirl of
    razor-sharp energy shards. Anyone who attempt to touch the target or make a
    melee attack against them must make an Evasion saving throw or suffer 1d6
    damage plus the caster's level before resolving their attack. The field of
    blades is indiscriminate and will affect even allies trying to touch the
    target. The blades remain as long as the target gives up a Move Action each
    round in order to avoid disrupting them from within, up to a maximum of one
    scene.
  duration: Up to 1 scene
