  description: >-
    A petitioner proposes a course of action to the PC. After a scene-long
    ritual involving at least 10 sp worth of livestock or sacrificial material,
    the GM makes a secret Wis/Magic skill check against difficulty 10. On a
    success, the PC gets an impression of whether the course of action will lead
    to success or failure, as the GM thinks most likely. On a failure, the GM
    gives a random result. Multiplying the ritual costs by 10 adds +1 to the
    skill check, thus, a sacrifice of 1,000 sp worth of livestock gets a +2 on
    the check. The same course of action cannot be divined more than once a
    month.
