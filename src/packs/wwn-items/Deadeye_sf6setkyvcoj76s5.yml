  description: >-
    You have a gift with ranged weapons. While this talent most commonly applies
    to bows, it is also applicable to thrown weapons or other ranged weapons
    that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you can't use the
    benefits of the Armsmaster Focus at the same time as Deadeye. Level 1: Gain
    Shoot as a bonus skill. You can Ready a Stowed ranged weapon as an Instant
    action. You may use a bow or two-handed ranged weapon even when an enemy is
    within melee range, albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may add your Shoot skill
    level to a ranged weapon's damage roll. Level 2: You can reload crossbows or
    other slow-loading weapons as an On Turn action, provided they don't take
    more than a round to reload. You can use ranged weapons of any size in melee
    without penalty. Once per scene, as an On Turn action when target shooting
    at an inanimate, non-creature target, you automatically hit unless you roll
    a 2 on your Shoot skill check or the shot is physically impossible.
