  description: >-
    By molding the plasmic stuff of life force, the necromancer can create a
    bond between two willing or helpless targets. These subjects must be close
    enough for the necromancer to touch; thereafter, for as long as the spell is
    in effect, the two creatures pool their hit points. Injuries to either
    subtract from this pool, and neither dies until it is reduced to zero,
    whereupon both are Mortally Wounded. They can communicate telepathically at
    will while the spell is in effect. The power ends at daybreak; if dispelled
    sooner, the remaining pool is split proportionately.
