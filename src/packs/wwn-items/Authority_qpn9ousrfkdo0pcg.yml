  description: >-
    You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others
    instinctively follow your instructions and further your causes. At level 1,
    this is a knack of charm and personal magnetism, while level 2 might suggest
    latent magical powers or an ancient bloodline of sorcerous rule. Where this
    Focus refers to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be
    in your service. PCs never count as followers. Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus
    skill. Once per day, you can make a request from an NPC who is not openly
    hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at a difficulty of the NPC's
    Morale score. If you succeed, they will comply with the request, provided it
    is not significantly harmful or extremely uncharacteristic. Level 2: Those
    who follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC being directly led by you
    gains a Morale and hit roll bonus equal to your Lead skill and a +1 bonus on
    all skill checks. Your followers and henchmen will not act against your
    interests unless under extreme pressure.
