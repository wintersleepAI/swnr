  description: >-
    A jade-colored sphere the size of an eyeball, this device may be pointed at
    any creature within sixty feet and activated by pressing a small stud. The
    target will be limned in yellow light if human, green if demihuman, and blue
    if non-human. The eye's categorization draws on the creator's personal
    taxonomu, so the result shown may not entirely agree with a user's opinion.
    Only the wielder can see this light, which lasts for 1d6 rounds. The eye's
    discernment can penetrate any mundane disguise or magical spell of third
    level or less. If the GM thinks the subject has a stronger kind of
    concealment, they may make a secret Wis/Notice skill check against an
    appropriate difficulty to determine if a true answer is given. The eye can
    be used once per scene.
