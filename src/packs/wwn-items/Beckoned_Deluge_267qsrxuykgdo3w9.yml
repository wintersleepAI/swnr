  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to conjure a considerable
    amount of water at a visible point within fifty feet per caster level. This
    water is sufficient to drench one 10-foot cube of matter per character
    level, making mundane bowstrings useless, extinguishing flames, and
    inflicting 1d6 damage per caster level on fiery supernatural creatures. This
    water persists indefinitely after its conjuration and is sufficient to
    hydrate ten people per caster level.
