  description: >-
    The caster may invoke this spell as an Instant action on any single creature
    within one hundred feet. Time is rolled back slightly, allowing them to
    replay their current round of action as if it never occurred, though all
    involved retain a memory of what originally happened. This spell is only
    useful on targets that are currently taking their round's actions; once
    they've finished for the round and another creature has started acting, it
    is too late to benefit from this spell. If the target is unwilling to roll
    back their action, they may make a Mental saving throw to resist the spell.
