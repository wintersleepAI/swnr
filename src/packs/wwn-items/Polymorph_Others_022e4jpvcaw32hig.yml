  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent Range: 60' A living subject is changed into another type
    of creature, as chosen by the caster: ▶ HD: The spell fails if the new
    form's HD is more than twice the subject's HD. ▶ Hit points: The subject
    retains the same number of hit points. ▶ Abilities: The subject truly
    becomes the new form: all special abilities are acquired, along with
    behavioural patterns, tendencies, and intelligence. ▶ Specific individuals:
    The spell cannot be used to duplicate a specific individual. ▶ Reversion: If
    the subject dies, it returns to its original form. ▶ An unwilling subject:
    May make a Mental save to negate the effect.
