  description: >-
    The diviner compels a person to drink a particular brew, participate in a
    specific ritual, or otherwise undergo a scene-long ordeal. Afterwards, the
    diviner may ask the target a single question and the GM secretly rolls a
    Cha/Magic skill check against a difficulty of the target's Morale+1, or
    level+6 for PCs. On a success, the subject must answer the question
    truthfully and fully. On a failure, they may give any answer they wish. The
    same or substantially same question may not be asked twice with this art.
