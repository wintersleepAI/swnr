  description: >-
    The caster imbues one visible ally per caster level with a burst of
    tremendous speed as their localized time begins to flow more rapidly. For
    1d4+1 rounds, all subjects get an extra Main Action during their turn. This
    Main Action may not be used to cast spells or use Arts. This spell severely
    taxes those who take advantage of it, adding 1 System Strain for each round
    in which the recipient takes the bonus action.
