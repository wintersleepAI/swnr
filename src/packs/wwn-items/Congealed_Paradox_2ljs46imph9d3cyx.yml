  description: >-
    These thumb-sized black gemstones are mildly painful to touch or look at, as
    each one contains an impossible duality that has been forcibly reconciled by
    ancient sorcery. When gripped and broken as a Main Action, the released
    paradox draws the immediate repression of the Legacy as mundane reality is
    violently reinforced in the surrounding twenty feet. Within that radius all
    active magic is immediately dispelled and no further spellcasting, art use,
    or magical power use can be performed inside it for the rest of the scene.
    Powerful Workings are suppressed within this zone for the rest of the scene.
    Creatures reliant on magic for existence take 5d6 damage for each full round
    they spend inside this radius.
