  description: >-
    A war robe is a catchall term for various outfits involving layers of
    reinforced cloth or leather. Bits of metal, layers of thick hide, or weaves
    of tough cordage might all go into the various layers of the suit, making it
    a very heavy, if effective, piece of equipment. Light armor may be decidedly
    heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer minimal hindrance to the
    wearer's actions. Some varieties are also discreet enough to be worn
    politely in common society.
