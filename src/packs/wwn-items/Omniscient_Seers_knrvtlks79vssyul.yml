    At the start of their turn, each hostile Stealthed asset within one turn's
    movement of the Omniscient Seers must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning check
    against the owning faction or lose their Stealth. In addition, all Cunning
    rolls made by the faction for units or events within one turn's movement of
    the seers gain an extra die.
