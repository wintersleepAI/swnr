  description: >-
    The caster carves open a metadimensional gate between their present location
    and a pre-set target point. Attuning the target point requires an hour of
    effort, after which this spell will open an opaque portal to it from a
    distance of up to one hundred miles per caster level. The portal is large
    enough to admit a cart and wagon and will remain open for up to one minute
    per caster level, ending when they pass through it. The gate is one-way
    only, from caster to target. Only living creatures and the vehicles they
    drive and objects they carry may pass through; atmosphere and other
    environmentals remain on the far side of the gate. Only one target point may
    be prepared for this spell at a time, and there is a 1-in-10 chance for
    every casting that the real destination is 1d100 miles in a random
    direction, discovered only after the portal is used.
