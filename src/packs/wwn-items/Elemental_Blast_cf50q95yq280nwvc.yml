  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to hurl a blast of some
    elemental force at a visible target within fifty feet per character level.
    The attack is made with Magic as the combat skill, Int, Cha, or Dex as the
    attribute, and a bonus to hit equal to your character level. It is not
    hindered by melee foes. On a hit, the attack does 1d6 damage plus your
    character level and attribute mod. The blast may have collateral effects on
    objects in the case of hurled fire or a torrent of pressurized water, but
    any conjured matter vanishes at the end of the round. Drag and Drop Weapon:
