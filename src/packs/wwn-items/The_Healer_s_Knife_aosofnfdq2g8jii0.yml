  description: >-
    Your Healing Touch ability is altered, and may be used to inflict damage to
    a living target instead of healing it. The damage done is equivalent to the
    healing that would normally be done, albeit you receive 1 System Strain
    instead of the target. Using this power in melee requires a successful Punch
    attack with a hit bonus equal to your Heal skill, with the damage added to
    any done by the blow, or simply touching an unwary target. Arts that modify
    your Healing Touch don't aid this power.
