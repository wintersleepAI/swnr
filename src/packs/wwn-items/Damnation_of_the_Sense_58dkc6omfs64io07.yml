  description: >-
    The caster targets a visible creature within two hundred feet. The target
    gets a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, one sense of the
    caster's choice is entirely under the caster's control for the rest of the
    scene, while a success leaves them bound only for the next round. Any false
    impression may be given, or any true one concealed, and a creature may be
    left effectively blinded or deafened. Distracting tactile sensations can
    force the victim to make a Physical saving throw in order to act each round.
    Blinded creatures can't make ranged attacks and roll all melee hit rolls
    twice, taking the worst result. If a creature thinks itself in mortal peril
    its excitement allows it to make a Mental save to throw off the spell at the
    end of each round.
