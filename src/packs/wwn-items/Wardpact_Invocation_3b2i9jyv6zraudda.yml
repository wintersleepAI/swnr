  description: >-
    This spell may be cast in two different forms. If it targets a creature
    within 200 feet, the target becomes partially immune to physical weapons;
    any weapon hit on them requires the attacker make a successful Physical save
    or the hit is negated. This effect lasts for one round per two caster
    levels, rounded up, and can't target the caster. If it targets a visible
    weapon within two hundred feet, that weapon is rendered entirely harmless
    and unable to inflict damage for the rest of the scene, with no saving
    throw. The spell may only affect a given target or weapon once per scene and
    natural body weapons aren't affected.
