    This art can only be taken by those who have mastered Surface Apprehension.
    It can only be used on a helpless or cooperative target; the Thought Noble
    may Commit Effort for the day and ask the target a question that takes no
    more than two sentences to ask. If the target fails a Mental saving throw,
    they must fully and completely answer the question. They need not exercise
    any personal judgment or speculation, but they must answer directly and
    without conscious deception.
