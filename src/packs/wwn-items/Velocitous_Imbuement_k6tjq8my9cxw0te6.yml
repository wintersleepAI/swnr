    Unlike most spells, this one may be cast as a simple On Turn action,
    targeting up to one visible willing creature per caster level within one
    hundred feet. Enchanted creatures become incredibly fleet of foot, doubling
    their usual ground movement rate and becoming capable of running up walls
    and across ceilings without falling, provided they end their round upright
    on a navigable surface. They may also move away from melee opponents without
    needing to make a Fighting Withdrawal to avoid a parting attack, and may
    pass through and around armed foes who do not completely physically block
    their path. The spell lasts for the remainder of the scene and adds 1 System
    Strain to those who take advantage of it.
