  description: >-
    The mage targets a visible, normal, non-magical animal or insect, obtaining
    temporary control of the beast and the ability to share its senses. The
    animal gains a telepathic bond with the caster, obeying any non-suicidal
    command and allowing the mage to perceive everything it perceives. The beast
    will not fight for the caster, but can perform complex actions entirely out
    of character for it while under the mage's control. The mage must focus to
    share the beast's senses, requiring a Main Action and leaving the mage
    unable to act physically while so focused. The spell lasts until the mage
    releases the beast, it is dispelled, or it is cast again.
  duration: Until dispelled, released, or cast again
