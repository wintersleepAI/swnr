    Duration: 12 turns Range: The caster This spell wards the caster from
    attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows: ▶ Bonuses: The caster
    gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of
    affected creatures. ▶ Affected creatures' attacks: Against the caster are
    penalised by &ndash;1. ▶ Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures: The
    spell additionally prevents such creatures from attacking the caster in
    melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such
    a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the caster still gains the
    save and attack bonuses mentioned above).
