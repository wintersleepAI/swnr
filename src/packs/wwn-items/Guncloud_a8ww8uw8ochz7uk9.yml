  description: >-
    This collection of ten silvery discs is intended to be applied to up to ten
    hand hurlants or one-handed thrown weapons. Once affixed to the weapons, the
    implements spatially collapse into a single gun or weapon until at least one
    disc is removed. When the bearer draws the weapon, all the conjoined
    implements immediately fan out around them in a whirling cloud, remaining
    within three feet of the bearer without obstructing their actions or vision.
    The bearer can fire or throw any of the weapons in the cloud as if they were
    Readied, provided they have at least one hand free. Thrown weapons will
    return to the cloud after ten rounds or one minute has passed, and
    discharged hand hurlants will reload themselves ten rounds after being
    fired, assuming the wielder is carrying ammunition for them. The cloud can
    be returned to its collapsed state as an On Turn action by the wielder
    should they sheath or holster one of the weapons. Foes in melee range who
    want to grab or smash one of the weapons must hit an AC of 16; four points
    of damage will smash a weapon or knock its disc off, but the guncloud discs
    themselves are immune to anything short of intentional damage inflicted by a
    possessor.
