  description: >-
    The caster probes the near currents of fate to discern the likely immediate
    outcome of an action. The caster describes a particular action they or a
    comrade intend to presently undertake, whereupon the GM tells them what is
    most likely to happen in consequence within the first five minutes after the
    action, as the GM thinks it most probable. This spell cannot be used more
    than once a week on the same general topic.
