    As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the scene and target a visible
    living creature. It gets a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, the
    GM will tell you exactly what it is currently intending to do on its next
    turn, or its next relevant action if used out of combat. If you perform a
    Total Defense action this round, your insight into its motions ensures that
    no attack it makes that you could theoretically physically avoid can hit you
    for the rest of the round.
