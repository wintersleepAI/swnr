  description: >-
    Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the Effort remains committed, you
    can speak with any animal that has fur, feathers, scales, or skin. This art
    allows them to temporarily speak as if they had human intellect, though
    their interests, knowledge, and desires do not change.
