  description: >-
    You can see and communicate with any undead creature, regardless of a shared
    language or the creature's natural state of invisibility. By Committing
    Effort for the scene you can sense the surface thoughts of any visible
    undead, including an impression of any commands or behavior it has been
    ordered to carry out. Unintelligent undead will not attack you or your
    companions unless specifically compelled to do so by a command or a master.
    Even intelligent undead will generally pause at least for an initial parley
    before attacking.
