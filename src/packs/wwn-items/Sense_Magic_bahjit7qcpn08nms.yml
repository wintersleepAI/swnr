    Commit Effort as an Instant action; while it remains committed, you can
    visually perceive magical energy and get a one-sentence description of the
    effect of any standing magics or magical items you inspect. The ambient
    magical energies in most areas allow you to see clearly even in conditions
    of perfect darkness.
