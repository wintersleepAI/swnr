  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to transform into an available
    alternate form. This shift persists until you die, shift to a new form, or
    end the transformation as an On Turn action. Your hit points, System Strain,
    and other scores remain the same in any new form, but in a non-humanoid form
    your class' base attack bonus can be no worse than the one listed on the
    table. If your shape is quadrupedal, its Move is 10' faster than your base.
