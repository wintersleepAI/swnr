  description: >-
    This form has an augmented degree of speed, strength, or hardiness. For this
    form, pick either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution; that attribute
    modifier is improved by +1 in this form, to a maximum of +2. These
    alterations are obvious and extreme; it is impossible to masquerade as a
    normal baseline human if using this art. Hit points gained from Con
    improvements are lost when shifting back.
