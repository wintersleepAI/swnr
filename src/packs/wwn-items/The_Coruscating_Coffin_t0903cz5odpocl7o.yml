  description: >-
    A thaumic discharge is focused on a single visible creature within one
    hundred feet per caster level, wreathing them in a lethal mantle of
    crackling energy. The target suffers 1d8 damage per caster level, with a
    Physical save for half. Targets with only 1 hit die will inevitably be slain
    regardless of the damage done. The spell cannot be blocked by non-magical
    intervening barriers, provided the caster can see the target with their
    unaided vision.
