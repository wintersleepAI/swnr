  description: >-
    A logos usually takes the form of a fist-sized sphere of luminous
    crystalline matter, a constellation of tiny lights glowing within. They
    radiate a sense of endless possibility; no sentient can look on a logos and
    not recognize it as an object of tremendous power. Only archmages know the
    full truth of their utility, but persistent rumor speaks of them as critical
    ingredients in certain rituals of apotheosis, immortality, and
    reality-shaping. Even the dullest mage can expend a logos as a substitute
    for 100,000 silver pieces worth of ingredients for creating Workings or
    magic items. If used to fuel a magic item's creation, no further special
    ingredients are required.
