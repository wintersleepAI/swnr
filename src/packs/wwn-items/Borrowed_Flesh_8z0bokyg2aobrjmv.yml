  description: >-
    When found, these potions fill only half their vials. If several drops of
    blood are let into the fluid by a willing subject, the subject may transfer
    up to six of their hit points into the elixir, accepting the damage and
    healing it normally afterwards. The blood droplets congeal and begin growing
    into a fleshy slurry once activated. A month later the slurry is digested
    back into its inert, half-full state, but until that point the brew may be
    poured on a wounded subject to restore as many hit points as were charged
    into it. The flesh that mends the wounds is of the same kind and texture as
    the flesh of the donor, though it will assimilate within a few months
    afterwards.
