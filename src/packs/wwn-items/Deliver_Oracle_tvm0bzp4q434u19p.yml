  description: >-
    A petitioner asks about the outcome of a particular course of action. The
    diviner then spends a day in various rituals, seeking an oracular answer. At
    the end, the GM makes a secret Wis/Magic skill check. If the skill check
    beats difficulty 8, an oracular sentence with some truth in it is produced.
    If the skill check beats difficulty 12, a direct and obvious oracle is
    produced. If the skill check is 7 or less, a hopelessly ambiguous oracle is
    produced, and if the dice roll a natural 2 an intentionally misleading
    oracle is delivered. Oracles are usually delivered as metaphors, poetry, or
    visions. The GM should ensure that some element of a true oracle actually
    does come to pass.
