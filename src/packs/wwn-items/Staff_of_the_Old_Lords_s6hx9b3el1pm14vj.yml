  description: >-
    These rods were once carried by certain human viceroys of the Outsider
    lords. So long as it is carried in one hand, it will automatically jerk to
    interpose itself before attacks made by human or demihuman foes, making the
    bearer immune to Execution Attacks or Shock and granting a +2 bonus to their
    Armor Class. For 24 hours after the staff is last touched, however, the
    bearer will find it impossible to perform a hostile act against an Outsider
    without first making a successful Mental save; on a failure, the action is
    lost. During this time any Mental saves made to resist Outsider spells or
    abilities must be rolled twice and the worst taken.
