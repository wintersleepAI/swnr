    A precious implement most often appearing as a miniature clock, hourglass,
    incense clock, or some other horological device, this item can wind back
    time by a few moments. As an Instant action, the bearer can invoke it to
    undo their actions and any consequences for the immediate turn, resetting
    their turn back to its beginning. This action cannot be taken after someone
    else's turn has begun. This object and others of its kind will only work
    once for any given user.
