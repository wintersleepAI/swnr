    When this potion is applied to a weapon, it gains a brief semi-sentience
    dedicated entirely to bloodshed. For the following scene, the wielder can
    accept a System Strain point to reroll a failed attack roll with the weapon,
    up to once per failed attack. A weapon affected by this potion cannot be
    used for less than lethal strikes.
