  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent / Instant (remove geas) Range: 30' The caster commands a
    subject to perform or avoid performing a specific action. ▶ Examples:
    Bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or drinking without
    restraint, keeping a certain fact secret. ▶ Impossible or deadly tasks: The
    prescribed geas must not be impossible or directly deadly&mdash;if such a
    geas is cast, it affects the caster, instead. ▶ Saving throw: The subject
    may make a Mental save to avoid coming under the spell's effect. ▶ If the
    save fails: The subject must follow the stipulated course of action or
    suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by
    the referee (e.g. penalties to attack, ability score reductions, inability
    to memorize spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.). Reversed: Remove
    Geas Can dispel an active geas spell and any incurred penalties. If the
    caster of the geas to be nullified is higher level than the character
    casting remove geas, there is a chance of the spell having no effect. The
    probability of spell failure is 5% per level the caster is below the caster
    of geas.
