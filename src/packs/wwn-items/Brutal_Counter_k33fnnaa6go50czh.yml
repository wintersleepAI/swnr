    Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action after resolving an enemy
    melee attack against you, whether it hits or misses. You may make a free
    physical attack against your assailant, using either a normal attack or some
    other offensive ability that takes no more than one Main Action to execute.
    You cannot use this art more than once per round against a single foe, but
    you may use it while performing a Total Defense.
