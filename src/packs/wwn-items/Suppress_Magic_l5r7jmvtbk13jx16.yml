  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action and target a visible or known
    magical effect within one hundred feet. The effect is suppressed as if by
    the @UUID[Compendium.wwn.arts.Item.zVoaLPVwZghGSACI]{Extirpate Arcana} spell
    for 1d6 rounds plus the caster's character level. Spells cast by more
    powerful casters may not be successfully suppressed, as noted in the spell
    description. The caster can attempt to suppress an effect only once.
