  description: >-
    Your hero has a remarkable degree of development to one or more of their
    attributes. This may be derived from an eldritch bloodline, native
    brilliance, or sheer, stubborn determination. This Focus cannot be taken by
    heroes with the Mage or Partial Mage classes. Level 1: Choose an attribute;
    its modifier is increased by +1, up to a maximum of +3. The actual score
    does not change, but the modifier increases, and may increase again if later
    advancement improves the attribute enough. You can choose this Focus more
    than once to improve different attributes.
