  description: >-
    You are a reincarnated transhuman, shards of your former life still
    lingering in your memories. The more intently you focus on developing and
    integrating these fragments, the more effectively you can call on them.
    Elves are invariably devoid of obvious mental or physical debilities. If you
    have any attribute scores below 9, you must move points from your other
    attributes to raise the deficient ones up to a score of 9. You may decide
    which attribute points to shift. Afflictions incurred after play begins can
    lower your attributes below this floor. If your PC is killed, it will
    reincarnate eventually, but it will likely be at a place far distant from
    the campaign. Such new incarnations are unlikely to ever be met again, and
    may not even remember anything particularly compelling about their most
    recent past life. Level 1: Pick any skill as a bonus skill reflecting your
    past memories. You may reroll a failed skill check in this skill once per
    day. You have extremely sharp senses, gaining Notice as a bonus skill and
    being able to see clearly in anything short of complete darkness. Level 2:
    Pick a mental attribute; gain +1 to your ability modifier in it, up to a
    maximum of +3 as you draw on past memories. Pick any skill as an additional
    bonus skill.
