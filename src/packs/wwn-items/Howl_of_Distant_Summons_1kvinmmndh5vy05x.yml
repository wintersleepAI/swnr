    You can call former animal companions to your side by Committing Effort for
    the day as a Main Action. The howl extends through time as well as space,
    and the subject will have received the message in time to reach your side
    within five minutes after you call for it. Once summoned, you may bind it
    again if you have no current companion. If the journey is exceptionally
    dangerous, difficult, or long, you'll need to make a Cha/Survive skill check
    against a difficulty of 10 or more; on a failure, the beast could not make
    the journey and cannot be called by this power for another week.
