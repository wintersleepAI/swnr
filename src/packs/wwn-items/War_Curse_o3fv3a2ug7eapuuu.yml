    As a Main Action, curse a visible enemy. They suffer a -2 penalty to hit
    rolls, damage rolls, and Shock damage for the rest of the scene. If they
    miss an attack with a raw to-hit die roll less than the Wise's Magic skill,
    they accidentally hurt themselves for normal damage. Only one war curse can
    be applied at a time.
