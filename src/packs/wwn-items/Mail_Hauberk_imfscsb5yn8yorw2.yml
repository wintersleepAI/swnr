  description: >-
    A mail hauberk in the listed style covers not only the wearer's chest, but
    also their arms, with a long skirt extended to the knee. As with a mail
    shirt, the padding beneath the armor is sometimes so thick as to qualify as
    protective gear in its own right Heavy armor is the thickest, toughest
    panoply available on the market, and its bulk and noise make its encumbrance
    apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert checks made by the wearer.
