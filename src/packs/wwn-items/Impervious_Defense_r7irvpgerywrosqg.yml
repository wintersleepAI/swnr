  description: >-
    Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, supernatural heritage, or
    magical talent, you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality armor.
    The benefits of this Focus don't stack with armor, though Dexterity or
    shield modifiers apply. Level 1: You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus
    half your character level, rounded up. Level 2: Once per day, as an Instant
    action, you can shrug off any single weapon attack or physical trauma
    inflicted by a foe. Environmental damage, falling damage, or other harm that
    couldn't be forfended by strong armor cannot be resisted this way.
