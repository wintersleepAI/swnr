  description: >-
    The elementalist charges their physical shape with the qualities of a chosen
    element for the rest of the scene. In all cases, they need not breathe and
    become immune to poisons and diseases not already present in them. If stone,
    they automatically stabilize at zero hit points and ignore the first three
    points of damage from any source of harm. If water, they can pass through
    any aperture a mouse could get through. If air, they can fly at their usual
    movement rate and gain a +4 Armor Class bonus against ranged attacks. If
    fire, they inflict 1d6 damage to all creatures in melee range at the start
    of their turn each round and become immune to heat damage.
