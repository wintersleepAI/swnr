  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target an adjacent solid
    surface. A glowing rune the size of a handprint forms on the surface and
    persists for one hour per caster level. Any creature who gets within two
    feet of the rune will trigger it, causing it to explode in a five-foot
    radius with an elemental force of your choice and suffering 2d6 damage plus
    your caster level. Creatures already within five feet of the rune when it is
    laid will not trigger it until they re-enter the area, nor will the caster
    trigger their own runes. Runes cannot overlap their areas of effect.
