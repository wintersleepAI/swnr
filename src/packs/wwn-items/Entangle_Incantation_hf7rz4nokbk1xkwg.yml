  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when an foe within 60'
    incants a spell. Your voice tangles with their words, forcing them to make
    an opposed Int/Magic vs Cha/Perform skill check against you, with a +2 bonus
    to your roll. If you tie or succeed, the spell fizzles and is wasted. This
    art can be used only once per round.
