    Duration: Concentration (up to 1 turn) or instant (see below) Range: 30'
    This spell has three uses: Ward: By concentrating and remaining stationary,
    enchanted or undead monsters that come within range may be banished or
    destroyed. Each monster may make a Mental save to avoid banishment or
    destruction. If a monster's save succeeds, it flees the affected area.
    Target single monster: Instantly banish or destroy a single enchanted or
    undead monster within range. The monster may make a Mental save (with a
    &ndash;2 penalty) to avoid banishment or destruction. If the monster's save
    succeeds, it flees the affected area. Dispel curse: Instantly dispel the
    hold that a cursed item has over a being within range.
