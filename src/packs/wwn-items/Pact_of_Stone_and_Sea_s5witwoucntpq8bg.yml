  description: >-
    The elementalist chooses earth, water, fire, or wind when casting this spell
    and selects a visible target to be affected. For the rest of the scene, the
    target is immune to injury caused by mundane manifestations of that
    substance; stone weapons don't harm them, water doesn't drown them, fire
    doesn't burn them, and wind doesn't topple them. This affects secondary
    effects of the material as well; a fire-pacted mage couldn't be boiled in a
    pot, and an earth-pacted one won't be suffocated if buried alive.
