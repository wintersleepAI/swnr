  description: >-
    The mage creates a phantasmal seeming at a visible location within 100 feet
    per caster level. The illusion can occupy a number of 10-foot cubes equal to
    the caster's level and can include visual, audible, olfactory, and even
    tactile elements. If onlookers have no reason to believe the illusion is
    false, they will unconsciously move and perceive so as to conform to its
    apparent physical qualities, halting before walls, reeling from imagined
    blows, and seeing their clothing burnt by phantasmal flames. The illusion
    will behave and act on its own in accordance with the caster's intentions
    for it, but it cannot go more than a hundred feet from where it was
    conjured. Phantasmal monsters fight with the caster's hit bonus, do 1d8
    damage, have AC 10, and vanish if struck. There can be no more than one
    active illusionary attacker per two caster levels. Foes brought to zero hit
    points fall unconscious and wake up ten minutes later with 1 hit point.
    Creatures convinced the illusion is false can make a Mental saving throw
    each round to reject its psychic influences, becoming immune to its effects.
    The illusion lasts until dispelled, the caster drops it, or this spell is
    cast again.
