    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and meditate upon a choice or
    potential action before you. The GM will tell you whether the likely outcome
    of that choice is weal, woe, a mix of both, or nothing significant, using
    their own best estimation. This insight cannot perceive likely outcomes more
    than an hour or so into the future.
