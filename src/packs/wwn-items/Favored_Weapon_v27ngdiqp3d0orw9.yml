  description: >-
    Choose one specific type of non-unarmed melee weapon from the list on page
    37. You begin play with such a weapon, and when using this type you may use
    the Favored Weapon attack bonus column on the Duelist table to determine
    your base hit bonus, unless it's already better for some other reason. If
    your second partial class is Partial Warrior, your class' base hit bonus
    with the weapon is instead equal to your level. You cannot apply this or
    other Duelist arts to thrown weapons.
