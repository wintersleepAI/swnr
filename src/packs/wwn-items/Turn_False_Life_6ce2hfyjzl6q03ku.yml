  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and make the sign of the Bleeding
    God before one or more visible targets within sixty feet. Roll 2d6 and add
    your character level; that many hit dice of undead, automatons, or other
    synthetic, extraplanar, or unnatural life forms must make Mental saving
    throws or cower for the rest of the scene or until they or their comrades
    are attacked. Cowering enemies will take no hostile action and may flee
    unless bound to their location. This power does not affect foes with twice
    as many hit dice as the blood priest has levels. If the rolled hit die total
    isn't enough to fully affect a creature, it is unaffected.
