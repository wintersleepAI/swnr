  description: >-
    A vast wall of thick, heavy vines and other plant life blooms from a visible
    point within one hundred feet per caster level. The wall is ten feet high
    and one foot thick and runs for twenty feet in width per caster level. The
    vine wall can be shaped as the caster wishes within the spell's area of
    effect, so long as it's contiguous, and may be laid horizontally if a bridge
    or roof is desired. Enemies must inflict five hit points of damage per
    caster level to cut a man-sized hole in the vines, and they must be using
    weapons or means that could actually cut through a wooden wall to do any
    meaningful harm. The vines may be optionally covered in long, vicious thorns
    to discourage climbing, inflicting 2d6 damage on any creature who tries to
    climb over it. If the vine wall is summoned from earth that could plausibly
    support plant life, it remains until dispelled or until it dies naturally.
    If called from bare stone or other infertile soils, it withers away to dust
    at the end of the scene
