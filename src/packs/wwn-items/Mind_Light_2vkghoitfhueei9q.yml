  description: >-
    Your Open Mind art is enhanced. While active, you become aware of the
    location of all living minds within sixty feet of you provided there isn't a
    physical barrier between you and the subject and they are not actively
    hiding from you. You can identify the species of these minds, if the species
    is known to you, any strong emotional states, and can recognize known
    individuals. While Open Mind is active you cannot be surprised by a living
    creature.
