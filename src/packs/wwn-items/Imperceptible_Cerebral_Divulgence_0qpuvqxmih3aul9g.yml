  description: >-
    The mage focuses on a visible living creature within 100 feet per caster
    level. For the rest of the scene, they immediately receive an impression of
    the target's surface thoughts and interests, understanding them regardless
    of any lack of a shared language. The caster may ask one question of the
    target's memories per caster level, but doing so risks breaking the spell;
    the target can make a Mental save before answering each question and the
    spell ends if the save is successful. These questions can only query
    memories, not compel any exercise of judgment or extrapolation. This spell
    is very subtle in its casting, and can be invoked without any visible
    gestures or audible incantations.
