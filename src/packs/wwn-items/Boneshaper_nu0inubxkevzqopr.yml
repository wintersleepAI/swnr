  description: >-
    The clay of flesh and bone run obediently to the will of the necromancer.
    Whether living or undead, a willing or helpless victim under the effects of
    this spell can be reshaped into any roughly-equivalent form with an hour's
    work. Limbs can be added or removed and existing tissue can be recolored,
    re-textured, or rearranged to the necromancer's wishes. Perfect imitation of
    a particular creature requires a Dex/Magic skill check against difficulty
    10. This spell is limited in the physical changes it can effect; a bonus of
    +1 can be added to modifier of Charisma or a physical attribute at the price
    of a -1 penalty to the modifier of one of the same attributes, to a maximum
    of +2 or -2. This spell lasts until the necromancer lifts it or it is
    dispelled.
