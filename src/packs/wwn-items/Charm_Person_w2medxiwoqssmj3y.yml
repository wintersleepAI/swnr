    Duration: One or more days (see below) Range: 120' A single human,
    demihuman, or human- like monster must save versus spells or be charmed, as
    follows: ▶ Friendship: The subject regards the caster as its trusted friend
    and ally and will come to the caster's defence. ▶ Commands: If they share a
    language, the caster may give the charmed creature commands, which it will
    obey. ▶ Subject's nature: Commands that contradict the charmed creature's
    habits or alignment may be ignored. ▶ Suicidal commands: An affected
    creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Restrictions:
    Human-like monsters of greater than 4+1 HD and undead are not affected.
    Duration: The charm lasts indefinitely, but the subject is allowed to make
    further Mental saves at intervals, depending on its INT score. If one of
    these saves succeeds, the spell ends. ▶ INT 3&ndash;8: The creature gains a
    new save once every month. ▶ INT 9&ndash;12: The creature gains a new save
    each week. ▶ INT 13&ndash;18: The creature gains a new save once every day.
