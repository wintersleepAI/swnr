  description: >-
    While these musical instruments often take the form of lyres, other
    manifestations have been found. When played by a competent musician for at
    least five minutes, all listeners within thirty feet must make a Mental
    saving throw or be seized by a great desire for a particular thing or
    purpose imagined by the player. This longing will not be enough to make them
    act wholly out of character, but they will perform all normally-conceivable
    acts in order to obtain the object of their longing, including quarreling
    fiercely with their fellows if this object cannot be shared among them. The
    enchantment lasts for the rest of the scene. The lyre can be used this way
    only once per day.
