  description: >-
    The corpse used for this spell must be of a relatively powerful creature
    with at least four hit dice or levels. The result is much like that of the
    Raise Corpse spell, but this undead servitor is much stronger, with 4 HD, AC
    15, a Move of 40'/action, a +1 skill bonus, saves of 13+, Instinct 0, Morale
    of 12, and a melee attack of +6/1d10, assuming it doesn't use a normal
    weapon. It is fully intelligent and self-willed, albeit utterly devoted to
    its creator, and it remembers a significant amount about its prior life. A
    grave knight regains all lost hit points at dusk each day, assuming it's not
    destroyed. A caster may have only one grave knight active at a time, and one
    that has been reduced to zero hit points is destroyed and cannot be revived.
