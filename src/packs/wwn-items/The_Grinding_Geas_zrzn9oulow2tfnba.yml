  description: >-
    A single visible living creature is struck with a grim geas, forcing it to
    comply with a particular command or else suffer a progressively-worse
    affliction. The caster may lay one single-sentence command on the target
    that is neither suicidal, indefinitely imprecise, nor likely physically
    impossible for them to comply with. Thus, the caster could geas a man to
    kill his son or never seek to harm his lord, but he could not reasonably
    command a peasant to become king or bind someone to forever after comply
    with a master's arbitrary commands. If the target then defies that geas or
    unreasonably delays its execution, they suffer an agonizing progressive
    wasting disease that will inevitably kill them in 1d6 weeks, applying -2 to
    their hit rolls and -1 to skill checks for each week that passes and halving
    their maximum hit points. If they again begin complying with the geas
    afterwards or if the curse is lifted, the disease halts and reverses itself
    at the same rate it progressed. An active target can make a Mental save to
    resist this spell, but they cannot if they are restrained, unconscious, or
    otherwise subdued. The curse lasts until dispelled or the caster lifts it.
