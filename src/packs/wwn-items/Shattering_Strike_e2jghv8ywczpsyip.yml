  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day and take a full round of motionlessness to
    prepare. On the next round, as a Main Action, your unarmed attack can
    shatter a wooden door, wooden wall, or other similar object up to a depth of
    one foot per level and a width sufficient to allow a man-sized creature to
    pass through. At fourth level this ability improves to affect even a stone
    wall and at seventh it can affect even a metal wall or solid iron door. The
    blow is useless against a target that can move, but against an immobilized
    creature the attack does 1d12 damage per character level.
