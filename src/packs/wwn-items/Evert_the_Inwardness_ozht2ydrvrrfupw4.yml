  description: >-
    A single visible target is selected, whereupon whatever contents that target
    may possess are extracted and placed in the caster's hands. If used on a
    cabinet, backpack, pocket, or other such container it can be no larger than
    an armoire, and the caster can choose whether or not to receive any
    particular object from inside it, being instantly appraised of its contents
    when the spell is cast. If used on a creature, it attempts to tear out the
    subject's innards; if the subject has equal or fewer hit dice than the
    caster, it must make a Physical save or die instantly. Whether or not it
    perishes, it suffers 1d10 damage per caster level, with a Physical save for
    half.
