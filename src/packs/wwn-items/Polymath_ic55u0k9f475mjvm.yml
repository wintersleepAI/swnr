    You have a passing acquaintance with a vast variety of practical skills and
    pastimes, and can make a modest attempt at almost any exercise of skill or
    artisanry. Note that the phantom skill levels granted by this Focus don't
    stack with normal skill levels or give a skill purchase discount. Only
    Experts or Partial Experts can take this Focus. Level 1: Gain any one bonus
    skill. You treat all non-combat skills as if they were at least level-0 for
    purposes of skill checks, even if you lack them entirely. Level 2: You treat
    all non-combat skills as if they were at least level-1 for purposes of skill
    checks.
