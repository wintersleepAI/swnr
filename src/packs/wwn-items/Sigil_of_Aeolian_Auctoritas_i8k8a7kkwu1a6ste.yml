  description: >-
    A fierce gust of wind may be conjured in a line a hundred feet long and
    thirty feet wide. All creatures of man-size or smaller must make Physical
    saves or be bowled over and blown back thirty feet, losing their next
    round's Main Action and suffering 1d6 damage. Light wooden constructions or
    similar structures are flattened by the wind. If used outdoors, the spell
    can instead control the local weather, transforming the quarter-mile around
    the caster into any climate found normally at that location at any point
    during the year. The spell cannot summon a tornado or other extreme weather,
    but it can call rain and conventional storms sufficient to cause flooding in
    areas prone to it. The gust of wind is instantaneous, but the weather change
    lasts for one hour per caster level before reverting to its natural state.
  duration: 1 hour per caster level
