  description: >-
    The mage designates a visible point within two hundred feet. A silent,
    invisible burst of soporific influence erupts from that point, targeting all
    living creatures within a twenty-foot radius. All such targets with 4 or
    fewer hit dice within that area fall unconscious instantly, and can be
    roused only by damage or by a Main Action used to kick them awake. If not
    roused, they revive at the end of the scene. Entities that do not sleep are
    immune to this spell.
