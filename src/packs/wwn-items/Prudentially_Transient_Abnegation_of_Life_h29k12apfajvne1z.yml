  description: >-
    This spell may be cast as an Instant action, even if another spell has been
    cast the same round, and targets either the caster or a willing visible
    target. It can only be used in immediate response to an injury that reduces
    the target to zero hit points. When it does, the target suffers dramatic and
    ostentatiously obvious death, with mortal blows cleaving them asunder or
    gorily butchering them. They are dead to all mundane or magical examination.
    Up to two hours later however, at the target's discretion, the various
    remains of the target flow back together and restore their body with two hit
    points per caster level and two additional System Strain points gained. If
    the target's remains are intentionally scattered widely, incinerated, or
    entirely eaten, however, they cannot revive. The subject is aware of their
    surroundings while "dead".
