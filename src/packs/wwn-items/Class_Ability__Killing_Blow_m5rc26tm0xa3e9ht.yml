  description: >-
    Whenever a Warrior inflicts damage with any attack, spell, or special
    ability they may add half their character level, rounded up, to the damage
    done. This damage is also added to any Shock they may inflict. Combined with
    Foci meant to improve Shock attacks such as Armsmaster, Close Combatant, or
    Shocking Assault, this ability ensures that an experienced Warrior will
    almost always kill any ordinary human soldier or minor monster, regardless
    of their attack roll result.
