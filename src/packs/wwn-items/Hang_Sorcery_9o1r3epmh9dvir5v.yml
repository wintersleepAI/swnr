  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when casting a spell. The
    spell does not go off, but remains "hung" and waiting to be triggered as an
    On Turn action, with details of targeting and effect determined at that
    time. Damage does not disrupt a hung spell, but no additional spells can be
    cast until the hung spell is released or allowed to dissipate.
