  description: >-
    A lost empire of sea-going lords has left behind only these loops of
    polished coral. Someone who wears one will be able to breathe underwater,
    see clearly out to 120' when submerged regardless of the light level, and
    they and their belongings are impervious to the chill and crushing pressure
    of the depths, though not to other sources of cold damage. The wearer's
    swimming speed is equal to twice their usual movement rate.
