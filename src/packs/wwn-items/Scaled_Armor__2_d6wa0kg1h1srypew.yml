  description: >-
    Scaled armor includes both armor of metal scales on a flexible backing,
    brigandine, jacks of plate, and other armor made up of small, connected
    plates that cover most of the wearer's body. Most are noisy, heavy suits,
    albeit flexible ones. Medium armor is significantly noisier and more overt;
    it cannot be worn discreetly and applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any
    physical Sneak rolls made by the wearer.
