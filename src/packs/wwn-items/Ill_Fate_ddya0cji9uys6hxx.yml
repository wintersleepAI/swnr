    As a Main Action, curse a visible target. You may specify a particular kind
    of undertaking or apply the curse to anything they may do. The next
    pertinent skill check they make is made at a -1 penalty. If their raw die
    roll is equal or less than the PC's Magic skill plus one their effort goes
    disastrously wrong. The curse lasts until the next relevant skill check.
