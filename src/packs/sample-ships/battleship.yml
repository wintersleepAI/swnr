  description: Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can create, only the richest modern worlds can afford to fabricate these massive engines of war. Even those worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at expending such a tremendous amount of money on a single ship. Those that do build battleships do so for a reason. The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.  The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it is only a single ship… a single, extremely expensive ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time, and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it.

      description: Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction of hydrogen from gas giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process requires four days of processing and refinement, but completely refuels the ship. Such fittings are common on explorer craft that cannot expect to find refueling stations.

      description: Forging new spike courses is too much an art to rely on computerized assistance, but an advanced nav computer can help on well-mapped routes. When navigating an interstellar drill course with charts less than a year old, the navigator decreases drill difficulty by 2.

      description: These sophisticated docking bays provide all the necessary tools and support for launching a starship from the mother craft. They are rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers, but some cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay allows room for one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the carried ship can support its own crew if necessary, most carriers fold their space wing into the mothership's crew roster. This fitting can be taken multiple times.
