  description: |-
    Patrol boats are often the largest ships fielded by poor or backward frontier worlds that lack the shipyard fa- cilities or available resources to build bigger military craft. Even so, the ability to field two patrol boats for the yearly maintenance cost of one corvette often ap- peals even to richer worlds that need more coverage than their available craft can provide. 
    Patrol boats are the smallest independent warships fielded by most navies, as fighters are not normally considered capable of extended independent opera- tion. They have considerable spike drive reach and are faster in-system than most of their potential targets. While their single mounted gun is vulnerable to being disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively thick armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can mitigate that danger. A few patrol boats replace their survey sensor array with a sandthrower to up-gun the ship, but most prefer the additional edge in scanning potential smugglers.
