  description: |-
    A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the standard free merchant is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling sig- nificant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while requiring very few hands to operate it. Only one crew member is needed for in-system flight, though spike drills require three for normal margins of safety.
    The standard free merchant is not a warship, but its sandthrower is enough to discourage pirate shuttles and the other small or fragile craft that wreckers or primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser is ideal for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out important systems on an attacking vessel, but the ship lacks the armor and durability to stand up to a true war- ship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a corvette might be threatened by the well-aimed guns of a small craft like this.
