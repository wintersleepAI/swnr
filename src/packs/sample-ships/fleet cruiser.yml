  description: |-
    The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the fleet cruiser is a ship-eating monster compared to its smaller brethren in the navy. Only prosperous polities can build such powerful ships, and even they sometimes find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of small craft rather than a few heavily-armed cruisers. 
    The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily- armored hull. Only special hunter-killer ships fitted with armor-piercing weaponry have any real chance of penetrating the cruiser’s thick skin. Those weapons are almost always more bulky and power-hungry than their peer weapons, so enemy polities must usually choose between building small ships that are very effective at defeating other small ships, or building hunter-killers that can threaten cruisers but are at a disadvantage against their less specialized brethren.
