  description: Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavyfrigate pushes the engineering parameters of a frigate hull to the maximum available to most TL4 worlds. Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate can intimidate any ship of its weight class. Its heavy crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots throughout a solar system.  However, despite the large weapon loadout, the heavy frigate remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true cruiser-class warship, and most frigates built for same-class engagements can be a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a bludgeon against the other small warships likely to be fielded by a peer star-faring polity.
