  description: |-
    Found only in rich, peaceful regions of space, the bulk freighter is capable of hauling thousands of tons of goods between star systems. While it’s equipped with enough of a sting to discourage small-ship piracy, it’s woefully inadequate to handle a warship, or even an up-gunned free merchant. 
    Some adventurers do find use for a bulk freighter hull, however, trading off some of its massive cargo space for more fittings and using customized modifications to allow the ship to support heavier power demands. While the end result is no match for a true cruiser, the sheer mass of the freighter can make it a dangerous opponent in the right hands.

      description: Cruisers and larger craft can’t land on planetary bodies, so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to a standard pressurized cargo container holding up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These containers are usually collapsible and take up no significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they’re not simply disposable cargo shells. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.

Any TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with the ship’s size.

There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is restocked.
