  description: <p>This is a particularly esoteric technique, one that requires the adept to have at least Program-0 or Fix-0 skill in order to master. With it, however, the metapsion has learned how to synergize with the quantum intelligence of a VI or True AI in order to apply Telepathy or Biopsion powers to their inanimate corpus. Only intelligent machines can be affected, as the technique requires a sentient mind to catalyze the effect.</p><p>This synergy takes much of its force from the adept. Any System Strain the powers might inflict must be paid by the adept rather than the target.</p>
