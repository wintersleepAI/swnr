  description: Gain Connect as a bonus skill. Once per game week, whenever it's convenient, gain one temporary Acquaintance Contact of your choice, describing them in any way the GM finds acceptable. You lose touch with this Contact after you use this Edge again, but you can use this Edge to connect with them again at a different time. You may also provide favors or payment sufficient to cement the relationship at the GM's discretion.
