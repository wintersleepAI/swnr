  description: 'Medkit: Containing a broad supply of pharmaceuticals, spray bandages, glue sutures, and a succinct handbook of injury care, the medkit is designed for handling sudden and drastic injuries. It also contains all the necessary tools for providing long-term recuperative care for critically injured characters. After each day of granting long-term recuperative care, roll 2d6 per patient treated; on a 12, the kit has run out of some vital pharmaceutical and has become useless.'
