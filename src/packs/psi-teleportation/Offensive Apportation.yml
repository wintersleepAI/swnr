  description: <p>The psychic can use <em>Personal Apportation</em> as a Main Action to teleport an unwilling target, provided the user can make physical contact with them. Contact with an unsuspecting or incapacitated target is automatic, while touching a resisting enemy requires a Punch hit roll with a bonus equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill. If the psychic does not use the <em>Burdened Apportation</em> technique then only the target is teleported; otherwise the user may go along with them. The psychic cannot teleport a target to any location they could not teleport to, including locations of imminent environmental danger, such as high in the air, into a windowless tomb, or into the middle of a sea. A conscious, resisting target can make a Mental saving throw to forcibly abort the teleportation, rolling at a penalty equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill. Use of this technique adds to the cost of <em>Personal Apportation</em>, requiring the psychic Commit an additional point of Effort for the day whether the touch hits or not.</p>
