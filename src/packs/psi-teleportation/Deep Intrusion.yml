  description: <p>The adept can use <em>Personal Apportation</em> to blind-teleport into a building, structure, vehicle, or spaceship visible to them, including spaceships close enough to engage in conventional ship-to-ship combat. They intuitively seek out a space large enough to hold them and without immediate environmental hazards, but cannot control their precise destination. Using this technique in conjunction with <em>Personal Apportation</em> is very draining to the psychic, and requires that they Commit an additional Effort point for the day.</p>
