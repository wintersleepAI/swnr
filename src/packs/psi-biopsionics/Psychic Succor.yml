  description: '<p>The adept’s touch stabilizes critically-wounded organisms. More sophisticated practitioners can heal tissue injuries, though curing diseases, detoxifying poisons, and fixing congenital deformities require additional techniques. Each use of <em>Psychic Succor</em> adds one point of System Strain to the target, or two points if they were mortally wounded at the time.</p><p>Activating <em>Psychic Succor</em> requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the rest of that scene without Committing Effort again.</p><p>Level-0: The psychic’s touch can automatically stabilize a mortally-wounded target as a Main Action. This power must be used on a target within six rounds of their collapse, and does not function on targets that have been decapitated or killed by Heavy weapons. It’s the GM’s decision as to whether a target is intact enough for this power to work.</p><p>Level-1: As level-0, and heal 1d6+1 hit points of damage. If used on a mortally-wounded target, they revive with the rolled hit points and can act normally on the next round.</p><p>Level-2: As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 hit points instead.</p><p>Level-3: As level-2, but healing 2d6+6 hit points instead.</p><p>Level-4: As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 hit points instead.</p>'
