  description: 'Field Radio: On worlds too primitive to have a comm grid, adventurers often fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A single type A cell powers them for months of use. Urban or rugged terrain limits their range to about two kilometers, while flat plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers. Someone with at least Program-0 skill can use the radioâ€™s shortwave functionality to communicate with a prepared target at continental distances if given ten minutes for tuning.'
