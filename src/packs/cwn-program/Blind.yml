  description: Deactivate a device's sensory input or make cyberware temporarily unable to get any input from anything but the wearer's nervous system. Cybereyes are blind, cameras sense nothing, and laser tripwires don't register the beam. Blind characters can't effectively attack at range, their movement rate is halved, and they suffer a -4 penalty to both AC and melee hit rolls.
