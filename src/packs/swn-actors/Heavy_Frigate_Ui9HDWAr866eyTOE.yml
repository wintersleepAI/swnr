  description: >-
    Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavyfrigate pushes the
    engineering parameters of a frigate hull to the maximum available to most
    TL4 worlds. Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even
    cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate can intimidate any ship of its
    weight class. Its heavy crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow
    it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots throughout a solar
    system.  However, despite the large weapon loadout, the heavy frigate
    remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true
    cruiser-class warship, and most frigates built for same-class engagements
    can be a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a bludgeon
    against the other small warships likely to be fielded by a peer star-faring
    polity.

        Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can
        simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4
        military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and
        integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear
        available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away
        or losing it in use may deplete it.
