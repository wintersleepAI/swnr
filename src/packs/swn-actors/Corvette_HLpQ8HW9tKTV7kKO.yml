  description: >-
    The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded frontier navies, a
    corvette is a true warship, albeit of a minimal size. While it is unable to
    land on worlds with standard gravity, its cargo lighter allows crew and
    cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its ex- tended stores allow
    for more than four months of field operation under normal crew parameters.
    Most pirates flying reworked free merchants or stolen patrol boats will turn
    tail as soon as a cor- vette shows up in the region. Good armor, multiple
    ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make a corvette a death
    sentence to most stellar ruffians, and even when a pirate wolf pack can
    bring one down, it usually comes at the cost of crippling damage. The model
    depicted here is standard for anti-pi- racy and basic system defense
    missions. Against cruis- er-class warships, however, this corvette’s weapons
    have insufficient armor penetration to seriously threat- en such a major
    warship.

        Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can
        simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4
        military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and
        integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear
        available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away
        or losing it in use may deplete it.

        Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures can be used to
        forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided the target’s engines have been

        empty space to either make an assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded

        Cruisers and larger craft can’t land on planetary bodies, so they
        require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only
        capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly twenty minutes
        either way, but can latch on to a standard pressurized cargo container
        holding up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These containers are
        usually collapsible and take up no significant space when compressed for
        storage, assuming they’re not simply disposable cargo shells. This
        fitting can be purchased multiple times.
