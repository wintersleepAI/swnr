  description: >-
    A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the
    standard free merchant is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling
    sig- nificant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while requiring very
    few hands to operate it. Only one crew member is needed for in-system
    flight, though spike drills require three for normal margins of safety.

    The standard free merchant is not a warship, but its sandthrower is enough
    to discourage pirate shuttles and the other small or fragile craft that
    wreckers or primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser is ideal
    for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out important systems on an
    attacking vessel, but the ship lacks the armor and durability to stand up to
    a true war- ship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a
    corvette might be threatened by the well-aimed guns of a small craft like
    this.

        Most ships require refueling after each drill jump, no matter the
        distance. Installing fuel bunkers allows the ship to carry one
        additional load of fuel. This fitting can be installed multiple times
        for ships that wish to minimize fueling.

        Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction of hydrogen from gas
        giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process requires
        four days of processing and refinement, but completely refuels the ship.
        Such fittings are common on explorer craft that cannot expect to find
        refueling stations.
