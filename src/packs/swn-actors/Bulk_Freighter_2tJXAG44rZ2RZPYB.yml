  description: >-
    Found only in rich, peaceful regions of space, the bulk freighter is capable
    of hauling thousands of tons of goods between star systems. While it’s
    equipped with enough of a sting to discourage small-ship piracy, it’s
    woefully inadequate to handle a warship, or even an up-gunned free
    merchant. 

    Some adventurers do find use for a bulk freighter hull, however, trading off
    some of its massive cargo space for more fittings and using customized
    modifications to allow the ship to support heavier power demands. While the
    end result is no match for a true cruiser, the sheer mass of the freighter
    can make it a dangerous opponent in the right hands.

        Cruisers and larger craft can’t land on planetary bodies, so they
        require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only
        capable of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly twenty minutes
        either way, but can latch on to a standard pressurized cargo container
        holding up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These containers are
        usually collapsible and take up no significant space when compressed for
        storage, assuming they’re not simply disposable cargo shells. This
        fitting can be purchased multiple times.

        Most ships require refueling after each drill jump, no matter the

        Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general
        supply of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any
        TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship’s locker in
        amounts commensurate with the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic
        armor might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is
        required. There is enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for
        normal use, but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete the
        locker until it is restocked.

        A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1 spike drive with
        additional phase filters and power throughput refinements. A captain
        needs buy only the final grade of drive desired. He does not have to buy
        upgrades sequentially. Drives of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5
        artifacts that cannot be built most modern worlds.
