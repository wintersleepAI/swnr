  description: >-
    The standard drill-capable fighter craft of most TL4 polities, this model
    retains a spike drive instead of replacing it with a cheaper systems drive.
    While the lone pilot would have to be desperate and heavily drugged to make
    an entire spike drill solo, it remains an option when no larger craft is
    available.

    This particular model is equipped with a reaper battery for dealing with
    small, lightly-armored civilian ships. “Bomber”-type fighters usually
    replace this with a fractal impact charge to threaten larger warships, while
    fighters built to dogfight their peers favor fitting a multifocal laser.

        This fitting must be put in place when the ship is built, and cannot be
        installed on cruiser-class or larger ships. A ship designed for
        atmospheric flight can land on most solid or aqueous surfaces.

        Stepped tapping of the spike drive power plant allows for the emission
        of a torrent of charged particles. The particles have very little armor
        penetration, but can fry a small ship's power grid in a strike or two.
