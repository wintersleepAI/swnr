  description: >-
    A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers throughout human space, the
    standard free merchant is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling
    sig- nificant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while requiring very
    few hands to operate it. Only one crew member is needed for in-system
    flight, though spike drills require three for normal margins of safety.

    The standard free merchant is not a warship, but its sandthrower is enough
    to discourage pirate shuttles and the other small or fragile craft that
    wreckers or primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser is ideal
    for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out important systems on an
    attacking vessel, but the ship lacks the armor and durability to stand up to
    a true war- ship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a
    corvette might be threatened by the well-aimed guns of a small craft like
    this.
