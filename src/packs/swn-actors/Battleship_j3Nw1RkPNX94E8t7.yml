  description: >-
    Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can create, only the
    richest modern worlds can afford to fabricate these massive engines of war.
    Even those worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at expending
    such a tremendous amount of money on a single ship. Those that do build
    battleships do so for a reason. The tremendous weight of fire these ships
    put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull
    plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers
    often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly
    require hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.  The main weakness of a
    battleship is the fact that it is only a single ship… a single, extremely
    expensive ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time,
    and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized
    anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the
    battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it.
