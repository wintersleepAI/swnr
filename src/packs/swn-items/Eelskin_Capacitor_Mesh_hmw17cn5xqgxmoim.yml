  description: >-
    A hair-fine mesh of almost imperceptible wiring along the user’s palms and
    fingers allow them to trigger brief, controlled bursts of electrical energy
    at targets within five meters. As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal
    damage to a successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it also allows the
    user to override and disable most electronic locks and security systems with
    a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering a burst and hacking a
    security system tax the user’s biology; one System Strain point is gained
    with each attack or skill check.
