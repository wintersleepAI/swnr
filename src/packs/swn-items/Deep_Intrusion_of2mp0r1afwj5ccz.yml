  description: >-
    <p>The adept can use <em>Personal Apportation</em> to blind-teleport into a
    building, structure, vehicle, or spaceship visible to them, including
    spaceships close enough to engage in conventional ship-to-ship combat. They
    intuitively seek out a space large enough to hold them and without immediate
    environmental hazards, but cannot control their precise destination. Using
    this technique in conjunction with <em>Personal Apportation</em> is very
    draining to the psychic, and requires that they Commit an additional Effort
    point for the day.</p>
