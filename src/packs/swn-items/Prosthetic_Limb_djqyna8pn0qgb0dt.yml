  description: >-
    Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and numerous internal organs can be
    replicated by postech medical science. These prosthetics can provide a good
    approximation of the sense of touch, and are usually impossible to
    distinguish from ordinary limbs without close inspection. Pretech-level
    worlds tend to prefer actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with
    access only to ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to be grateful
    to prosthetics.
