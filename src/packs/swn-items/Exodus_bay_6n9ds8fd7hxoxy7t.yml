  description: >-
    These banked rows of compressed cold sleep pods are designed to carry
    enormous numbers of people in extended hibernation, most often colonists to
    some new homeworld or escapees from some stellar disaster. A cruiser can
    carry up to 1000 colonists in stasis, while a capital ship can handle up to
    5000. Each further time this fitting is selected, these numbers double.
    These pods put Their inhabitants into very deep hibernation so as to
    minimize the resources necessary to maintain their lives. Bringing them out
    of stasis requires a month of 'defrost'. Crash awakenings have a 25% chance
    of killing the subject. The pods are rated for 100 years of stasis, but
    their actual maximum duration is somewhat speculative.
