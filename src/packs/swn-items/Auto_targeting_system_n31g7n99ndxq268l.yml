  description: >-
    Some ships run with more guns than crewmen. A single NPC or PC can man one
    gun per round, firing it as often as gunnery chief's Fire One Weapon or Fire
    All Guns actions allow, but sometimes that's not enough. Installing an
    automatic targeting system for a gun allows it to shoot at a +2 hit bonus
    without human assistance. This system must be installed once for each gun
    that is to be self-manned.
