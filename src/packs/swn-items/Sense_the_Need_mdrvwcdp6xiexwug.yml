  description: >-
    <p>At some point in the recent past, the psychic had a vague but intense
    premonition that a particular object would be needed. By triggering this
    power as an Instant action and Committing Effort for the day, the psychic
    can retroactively declare that they brought along any one object that they
    could have reasonably acquired and carried to this point. This object must
    be plausible given recent events; if the psychic has just been
    stripsearched, very few objects could reasonably have been kept, while a
    psychic who’s just passed through a weapons check couldn’t still have a
    loaded laser pistol.</p>
