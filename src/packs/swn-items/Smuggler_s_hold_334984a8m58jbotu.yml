  description: >-
    Carefully-designed storage space intended to conceal illicit cargo from
    customs inspection. Each installation of this fitting adds 200 kilograms of
    cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons in a frigate, 20 tons in a cruiser, or 200
    tons in a capital ship. Cargo in smuggler's hold will never be found by a
    standard customs inspection. Careful investigation by a suspicious official
    can find it on a difficulty 10 check using their Wis/Notice skill, and a
    week-long search one step short of disassembly will find it on a difficulty
    7 check.
