  description: >-
    An assault suit represents the most sophisticated armor in common use among
    TL4 worlds. An assault suit requires a type B power cell for 24 hours of
    operation, and provides integral encrypted military comms, low-light and
    infrared vision, and a built-in energy feed interface. The latter allows the
    wearer to connect the suit to any one weapon or device that uses a type A
    power cell as a Main Action. So long as the device remains connected to the
    suit, it is treated as having unlimited ammunition or operation time. The
    suit also functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered, one that
    cannot be torn by edged weapons.
