  description: >-
    <p>The teleporter can translocate to another location they have either
    occupied before or can see with their unaided vision. Locations are fixed in
    reference to the nearest major gravity well. For example, it is not possible
    to teleport to the cockpit of a distant moving vehicle they once occupied,
    but they can teleport to another point on a planet’s surface even though the
    planet has since moved far through the stellar void.</p><p>The core
    technique allows the teleporter to move himself and any mass he is able to
    carry with his own natural strength. Resisting targets cannot be carried
    along, and unresisting ones must be touched. A teleporter can leave any
    clothing, shackles, adhesions, or other matter behind when he teleports, but
    he cannot leave behind matter that has been inserted into his body, such as
    cybernetics or shrapnel. Matter cannot be partially left behind.</p><p>A
    teleporter will instinctively abort any apportation that would leave him
    embedded in a solid object or in an environment of imminent physical harm.
    Any Committed Effort on such aborted jumps is wasted, as is any action spent
    triggering the power.</p><p>The maximum range of <em>Personal
    Apportation</em> depends on the teleporter’s skill level. Teleporting with
    <em>Personal Apportation</em> counts as a Main Action and requires that the
    psychic Commit Effort for the scene.</p><p>Level-0: The psychic can teleport
    up to 10 meters.</p><p>Level-1: The psychic can teleport up to 100
    meters.</p><p>Level-2: The psychic can teleport up to 10
    kilometers.</p><p>Level-3: The psychic can teleport up to 1,000
    kilometers.</p><p>Level-4: The psychic can teleport anywhere on a planet’s
    surface or near orbit.</p>
