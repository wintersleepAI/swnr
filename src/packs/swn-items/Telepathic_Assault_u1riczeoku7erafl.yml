  description: >-
    <p>The telepath Commits Effort for the day as a Main Action to force a wave
    of metadimensional energy through the brain of a <em>Telepathic Contact</em>
    target. The assault does 6d6 damage, or 9d6 damage if the telepath has
    Telepathy-4 skill. The target may make a Mental saving throw to halve the
    damage. This assault cannot kill a target, but can knock them unconscious
    for an hour if theyâ€™re reduced to zero hit points, after which they wake up
    with one hit point. A victim cannot be targeted by an assault more than once
    per scene.</p>
