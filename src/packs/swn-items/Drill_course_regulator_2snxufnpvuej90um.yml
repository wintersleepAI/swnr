  description: >-
    Drills along a known spike drive route have no chance of failure so long as
    the route is no longer than twice the operating pilot's skill level and does
    not onvolve course trimming. Thus, a navigator with Pilot-1 skill would
    always succeed in making a drill of two hexes or less, provided the route
    was a known one. The drill course regulator requires a siphisticated
    technical base and compatible metadimensional energy conditions in a given
    sector; many sectors no longer have this technology or lack the right
    environment to use it. If the GM prefers a campaign where space travel is
    always at least somewhat dangerous, they may deny access to this fitting.
    Ships piloted by exceptionally talented navigators may choose not to mount
    it even the.
