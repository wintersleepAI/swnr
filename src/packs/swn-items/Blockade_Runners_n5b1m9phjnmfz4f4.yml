  description: >-
    These starship captains excel at transporting goods through unfriendly
    lines. As an action, a blockade runner can transfer itself or any one
    Military Unit or Special Forces to a world within three hexes for a cost of
    two FacCreds. They can even move units that would otherwise require
    planetary government permission to enter.
