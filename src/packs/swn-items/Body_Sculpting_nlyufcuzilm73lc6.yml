  description: >-
    Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body
    sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced medical
    services. After a week of alterations and treatments a subject’s external
    appearance can be desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment that costs
    ten times as much can involve extensive DNA reprogramming to change the
    subject at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable and allowing
    female-targeted shapes to bear offspring. This TL5 treatment is not
    reversible, and any further major alterations to the subject require further
    permanent System Strain.
