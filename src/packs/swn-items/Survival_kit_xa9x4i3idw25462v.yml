    Survival kit: A standard belt-worn kit with fire lighter, water filter,
    three thermal flares, knife, thermal blanket, a brightly-colored 3 x 3 meter
    waterproof tarp, a glowbug, and a radio beacon that can transmit a distress
    signal up to fifty kilometers for one month on the included type A power
    cell. Survival kits sold on a particular world will usually also include a
    small booklet on specific dangers or edible organics. Possession of a
    survival kit grants a +1 to all relevant Survive skill checks, assuming its
    contents are helpful on a given planet. Survival kits are well-organized,
    and count as only one item for encumbrance purposes.
