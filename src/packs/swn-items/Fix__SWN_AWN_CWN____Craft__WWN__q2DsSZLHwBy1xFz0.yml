  description: >-
    <p>Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How complex will
    depend on your character’s background; a lostworlder blacksmith is going to
    need some study time before he’s ready to fix that broken fusion reactor,
    though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things, build things, and
    identify what something is supposed to do.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Craft or
    repair goods and technology appropriate to the PC’s background and society.
    The Craft skill can be used for a wide range of artisan pursuits, though a
    GM is within their rights to keep the PC from building complex things that
    are too far away from their past background and experience.</p>
