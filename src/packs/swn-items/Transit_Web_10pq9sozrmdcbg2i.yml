    These facilities allow almost effortless relocation of all assets. For one
    FacCred, any number of non-starship Cunning or Wealth assets may be moved
    between any two worlds within three hexes of the Transit Web. This may be
    done freely on the owner's turn so long as the fee can be paid, and using
    the ability doesn't require an action.
