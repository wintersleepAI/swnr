  description: >-
    <p>The biopsion becomes extremely difficult to kill, encoding their mind in
    a coherent pattern of MES energy coterminous with their realspace
    coordinates. If killed, the psychic will regenerate from the largest
    remaining fragment of their body over 24 hours. This process maximizes their
    System Strain for one week. If brought to zero hit points during this week,
    they die instantly and permanently. The psychic retains a vague awareness of
    their surroundings while “dead” and can postpone their regeneration for up
    to a week in order to avoid notice, but burial or entombment may result in a
    very short second life. Each use of this power inflicts one point of
    permanent attribute loss in an attribute of the biopsion’s choice.</p>
