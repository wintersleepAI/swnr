  description: >-
    Hush (Heal-0): An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer, Hush leaves the subject
    awake and responsive to simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight or
    communicate while affected by Hush, but will walk, eat, sit, and perform
    simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush dose
    lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of the person applying the stim,
    and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must
    be immobilized or willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement
    immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects.
