  description: >-
    The pride of an empire, this is a collection of massive capital warships
    without peer in most sectors. Capital fleets are expensive to keep flying,
    and cost an additional 2 FacCreds of maintenance each turn. As an action,
    they may move to any world within three hexes of their current location.
    Planetary government permission is required to raise a capital fleet, but
    not to move one into a system.
