  description: >-
    <p>As an On Turn action, the metapsion may Commit Effort and form a psychic
    gestalt with one or more willing psychics within three meters, including up
    to one other psychic per Metapsion skill level. This gestalt persists as
    long as the Effort remains committed, regardless of the subsequent distance
    between psychics. On their own turn, any member of the gestalt may use any
    power or technique known by any other member, using the other member’s skill
    levels as necessary and paying any Effort cost from their own pool. This
    gestalt shares only psychic power, not thoughts or senses. At the end of
    each round in which one or more members have used some other member’s powers
    or abilities on their turn of action, the metapsion must Commit Effort for
    the scene or the gestalt drops and cannot be re-established for the rest of
    the scene.</p>
