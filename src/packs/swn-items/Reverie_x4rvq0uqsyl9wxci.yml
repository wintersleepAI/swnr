  description: >-
    Reverie (Heal-1): This very dangerous combat drug completely subdues the
    subject’s fear centers and adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly
    calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal danger. Their reaction speed is
    much slower as a consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat
    rounds; so on the second, fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage
    they suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect
    calm allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they can
    make Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit rolls; the
    difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges
    for the weapon. The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks made
    under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for ten minutes and adds 2 System
    Strain to the target.
