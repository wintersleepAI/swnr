  description: >-
    Convince others to also do whatever it is you’re trying to do. Talk might
    persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make them do it even
    when they think it’s a bad idea. Roll it to lead troops in combat, convince
    others to follow you, or maintain morale and discipline.
