  description: >-
    Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, gengineered skin fibers,
    or subtle telekinetic shielding, you have natural defenses equivalent to
    high-quality combat armor. The benefits of this focus donâ€™t stack with
    armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.<br /><br />Level 1: You
    have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half your character level, rounded
    up.<br />Level 2: Your abilities are so effective that they render you
    immune to unarmed attacks or primitive weaponry as if you wore powered
    armor.
