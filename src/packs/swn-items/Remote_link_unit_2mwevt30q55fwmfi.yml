  description: >-
    Remote link unit: These data broadcast link units have been preloaded with
    one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and
    sophisticated data progression algorithms. Two of these links can allow a
    user to maintain contact with a remote data storage unit. The connection is
    too “stiff” to allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a -2 penalty
    to any attempts to hack through it. Professional-grade security systems
    often have means to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit.
