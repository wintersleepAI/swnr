  description: >-
    Not an asset, per se, but a special quality that can be purchased for
    another Special Forces asset on the planet. An asset that has been Stealthed
    cannot be detected or attacked by other factions. If the unit normally
    requires the permission of a planetary government to be moved onto a planet,
    that permission may be foregone. An asset loses its Stealth if it is used to
    attack or defend.
