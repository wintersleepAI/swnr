  description: >-
    The ship can disguise its long-range sensor readings, spoofing scans with
    the ID tags and apparent hull type of any other ship of its choice. To
    penetrate this masquerade, the scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program skill
    check against difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking ship's
    comms officer. Once the ship is close enough to visually identify, the
    masking is useless.
