  description: >-
    <p>The psychic may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to gain an intuitive
    360-degree awareness of their physical surroundings. The sense is roughly
    equivalent to sight out to 100 meters, though it cannot read text or
    distinguish colors. It is blocked by solid objects but is unimpeded by
    darkness, mist, blinding light, holograms, or optical illusions. The sense
    lasts as long as the Effort remains Committed to the technique.</p>
