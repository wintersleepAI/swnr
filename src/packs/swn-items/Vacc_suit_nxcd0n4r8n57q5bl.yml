  description: >-
    Vacc skin: A more advanced TL5 version of the vacc suit, this skin-tight
    suit can be worn as a readied item in conjunction with armor, though it
    grants no Armor Class bonus itself. It requires no oxygen tank,
    automatically cracking and recycling the wearer’s respiration, and can even
    recycle the wearer’s bodily waste into drinkable water if necessary. Vacc
    skins apply no penalty to hit rolls or skill checks for wearers. It suffers
    tears in the same way as a normal vacc suit, and requires a type A power
    cell for each 24 hours of operation.
