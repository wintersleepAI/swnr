  description: >-
    Large weapons are two-handed implements of bodily ruin such as claymores,
    halberds, tetsubos, or other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they rely
    largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash through lighter forms of
    armor. Large weapons count as two encumbrance items. A primitive weapon is
    simply one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech augmentations.
    Primitive weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered armor.
