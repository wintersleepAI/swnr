    adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When rollingHeal skill
    checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.<br />Level 2: Stims or other
    technological healing devices applied by you heal twice as many hit points
    as normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you can heal 1d6+Heal skill

    ten minutes of first aid spread among them. Such healing can be applied to a
    given target only once per day.
