  description: >-
    Exhaustively cataloged psychometric records on important and influential
    local figures, allowing uncanny accuracy in predicting their actions. Once
    per turn, a Book of Secrets allows the faction to reroll one die for an
    action taken on that world or force an enemy faction to reroll one die. This
    reroll can only be forced once per turn, no matter how many Books of Secrets
    are owned.
