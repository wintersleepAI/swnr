  description: >-
    The ship is equipped with a full-scale TL4 fabrication plant programmed to
    support its needs. The ship can stock raw materials and parts at 5000
    credits per ton; these parts can then be used to "pay" ship repair or
    maintenance costs when conventional shipyards are unavailable. The factory
    can also create repair vehicles, TL4 equipment, space habs, and planetary
    structures with these parts at a rate of 10000 credits worth of construction
    a day. If a mobile extractor is available, the raw materials processed by
    the latter unit can be used to feed the factory. Operating a mobile factory
    requires at least 100 well-trained personnel. Each 10 fewer doubles repair
    or maintenance times.
