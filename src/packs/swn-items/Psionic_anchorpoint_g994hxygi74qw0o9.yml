  description: >-
    This pretech relic is unavailable on the open market in most sectors. Once
    installed in a ship, it can be "imprinted" by up to a dozen psychics. These
    psychics can sense and affect any object or location within ten meters of
    the relic after one minute of concentration, provided they are within the
    same solar system. Thus, teleporters can always teleport next to the
    anchorpoint, telepaths can always contact anyone within the affected zone,
    telekinetics can manipulate objects near the relic, and so forth. The relic
    can be re-coded to eliminate existing imprints, but any psychic wo gets
    access to the relic for ten minutes of meditation and focus can imprint on
    it afterwards. There is no obvious way to tell how many psychics have
    imprinted to the anchorpoint.
