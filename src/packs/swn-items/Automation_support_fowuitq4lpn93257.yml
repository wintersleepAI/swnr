  description: >-
    The ship has been carefully fitted to support the use of non-sentient expert
    system robots in its operation. At least one human, VI, or True AI crew
    member is necessary to oversee the bots and monitor spike drills, but
    otherwise crew may be replaced with cheap, basic robots at a cost of 1000
    credits per crew member replaced. Bots don't draw any pay, don't take up
    life support, and their maintenance is assumed to be part of the ship's
    operating costs. These bots are incapable of any actions unrelated to
    operating the ship and are treated as level-0 in their skills where
    relevant.
