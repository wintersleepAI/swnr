  description: >-
    Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are embedded in the subjectâ€™s hands and
    feet as part of this complex surgery. While they are too weak to allow
    levitation or damping fall damage, they can twist localized gravity around
    those limbs to anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable of bearing
    their weight. As a result, the user can freely run or climb up or down sheer
    surfaces at their normal movement rate, carrying no more than their normal
    maximum encumbrance.
