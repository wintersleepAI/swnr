    Stiletto charge: These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion charges
    were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily overcome primitive
    colonial data security measures. Each charge is a small interface plug the
    size of a human thumb. When used as part of a hack against a TL4 system, it
    causes the skill check to automatically succeed regardless of the
    difficulty. Without line shunts, however, the duration of the hack is still
    no more than the usual 1d4 rounds plus the hackerâ€™s Program skill. These
    devices are single-use, and are prized so highly that they are almost always
    unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the right people and the
    looting of Mandate remnants are the only normal ways to acquire these
    devices.
