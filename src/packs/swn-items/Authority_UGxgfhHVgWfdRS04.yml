  description: >-
    You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others
    instinctively follow your instructions and further your causes. At level 1,
    this is a knack of charm and personal magnetism, while level 2 might suggest
    latent telepathic influence or transhuman memetic hacking augmentations.
    Where this focus refers to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily
    chosen to be in your service. PCs never count as followers.<br /><br />Level
    1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you can make a request from an
    NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at a
    difficulty of the NPCâ€™s Morale score. If you succeed, they will comply with
    the request, provided it is not harmful or extremely uncharacteristic.<br
    />Level 2: Those who follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC being
    directly led by you gains a Morale and hit roll bonus equal to your Lead
    skill and a +1 bonus on all skill checks. Your followers will not act
    against your interests unless under extreme pressure.
