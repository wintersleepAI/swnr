  description: >-
    This broad-spectrum scrub system carefully identifies and contains toxic
    substances introduced into the userâ€™s system. Whenever the subject would
    normally have to make a saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they
    may instead gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save.
    Most of these systems are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins or
    chemicals in standard use by police or military forces in the sector, but if
    presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the filters are less effective.
    In such cases, the most it can do is either grant a second saving throw if
    the first is failed, or grant a single saving throw if none is normally
    allowed.
