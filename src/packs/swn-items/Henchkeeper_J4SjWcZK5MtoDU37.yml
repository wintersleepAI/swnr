  description: >-
    You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do your
    bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement,
    sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A
    henchman obtained with this focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly
    betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important”
    people in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the
    desperate, or other persons with few options. You can use more conventional
    pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings
    are no more loyal or competent than your pay and treatment can purchase.<br
    /><br />Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within
    24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench
    material. These henchmen will not fight except to save their own lives, but
    will escort you on adventures and risk great danger to help you. Most
    henchmen will be treated as Peaceful Humans from the Xenobestiary section of
    the book. You can have one henchmen at a time for every three character
    levels you have, rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings
    at any plausible time and pick them back up later should you be without a
    current henchman.<br />Level 2: Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and
    determined, and will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming
    odds. Whether through natural competence or their devotion to you, they’re
    treated as Martial Humans from the Xenobestiary section. You can make
    faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs, but this requires
    that you actually have done them some favor or help that would reasonably
    earn such fierce loyalty.
