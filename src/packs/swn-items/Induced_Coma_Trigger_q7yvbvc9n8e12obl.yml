  description: >-
    A series of implants are wired to the userâ€™s brain stem, allowing them to
    trigger an induced therapeutic coma at a mental command. The user appears
    dead to anything short of a medical inspection, and has no need of
    respiration, food, or water while the coma is in effect. The user does not
    heal while in a coma, but any diseases or poisons also halt progression. The
    user determines how long the coma is to last before triggering it, and is
    unconscious for its duration. A character can survive in a coma up to two
    weeks before needing to regain consciousness for as long as they were in the
    coma.
