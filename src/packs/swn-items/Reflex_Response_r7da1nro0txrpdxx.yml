  description: >-
    <p>As a Main Action, the telepath can Commit Effort for the day to force a
    sudden, irrational impulse into the target of a <em>Telepathic Contact</em>.
    The target may make a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, they will
    use their next available action to carry out the impulse to the best of
    their ability. This impulse cannot be self-injurious or harmful to a loved
    one, but it can be foolish, reckless, or harmful to others. The target may
    not understand why they have done the action, but will usually attempt to
    rationalize it as their choice.</p>
