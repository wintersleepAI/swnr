  description: >-
    These drones are invariably short-lived due to enormous energy signatures
    they produce, but until the ship's next turn they grant a +2 AC bonus as
    their emissions confuse foes. Foxer drones are cheaply constructed and
    essentially free; the only limit on their number is the amount of free space
    set aside for holding them.
