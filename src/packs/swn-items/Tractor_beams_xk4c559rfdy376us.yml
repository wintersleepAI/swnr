  description: >-
    Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate objects within its
    immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding objects no larger than a ship
    of one hull class smaller. Targets with ship-scale propulsion can resist the
    beams, but lifeboats, individual suit jets, or other smaller propulsors are
    inadequate. The beam can focus only on one Object at a time but can move it
    into the ship's cargo bays or hurl it out of the ship's immediate vicinity
    within three rounds. The beams can only effectively manipulate objects in
    very low gravity, and not those on the surface of planets or other objects
    with significant natural gravity.
