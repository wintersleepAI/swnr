  description: >-
    Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain
    chemicals in the user when activated while exciting the userâ€™s perceptual
    centers. This combination produces a cold, dispassionate situational
    awareness that grants the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is
    engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent
    psychological addiction and brain damage, allowing the unit to be used for
    no more than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty on all social
    skill checks while the unit is active, and it requires five rounds to toggle
    it.
