  description: >-
    <p>The precog observes an incoming injury and tries to find an alternate
    future in which the attack misses. As an Instant action, the precog can
    Commit Effort for the day to force an attacker to reroll a successful hit
    roll. This technique only works on attacks against the psychic’s person, not
    against attacks aimed at a vehicle they’re occupying or harm that doesn’t
    involve an attack roll. If the rerolled attack still hits, however, the
    damage done is maximized. This technique can be used only once per incoming
    attack.</p>
