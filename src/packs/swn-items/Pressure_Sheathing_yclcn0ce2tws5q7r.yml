  description: >-
    Occasionally purchased by workers in hard vacuum or other hostile
    environments, pressure sheathing integrates an ultrathin pressure membrane
    with the user’s dermis and emergency film sealants that trigger at the
    user’s mental command. The pressure sheathing serves as an emergency vacc
    suit with an integral oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can
    sustain them for up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath needs 48 hours to
    regain structural integrity and power after triggering. A pressure sheath
    can be detected only by a close medical examination.
