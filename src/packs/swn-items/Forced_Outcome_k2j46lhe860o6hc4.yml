  description: >-
    <p>Through careful manipulation of probability, the adept can influence
    random physical events in their vicinity. Triggering this technique requires
    a Main Action and Committing Effort for the scene. Any simple, random
    mechanical outcome can be completely controlled for the scene, such as a
    roulette wheel or the order of a deck of shuffled cards. Any other physical
    event in the area that seems not-entirely-implausible may be made to occur
    by this technique, provided it doesn’t involve more than a few objects and
    doesn’t require human involvement. The GM decides what random events are and
    are not adequately possible. Anything more than one unusual coincidence or
    chance per scene is likely impossible to produce.</p>
