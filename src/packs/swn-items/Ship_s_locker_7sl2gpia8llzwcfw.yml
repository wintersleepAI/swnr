  description: >-
    Much like an armory, this option allows a captain to lay in a general supply
    of equipment likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any TL4
    equipment on the gear list can be found in the ship's locker in amounts
    commensurate with the ship's size. A few guns and some basic armor might be
    included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is
    enough gear available to outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving
    it away or losing it in use may deplete the locker until it is restocked.
