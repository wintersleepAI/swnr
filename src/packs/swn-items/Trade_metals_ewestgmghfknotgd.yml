  description: >-
    Trade metals: The fruit of common TL4 asteroid mining, trade metals include
    gold, platinum, artificial gemstones, and other substances precious on many
    lost worlds and trivially valuable on spacefaring ones. A kilo worth of
    trade metals can be exchanged for as much as a thousand credits worth of
    local products on metal-poor worlds isolated from interstellar trade.
    Markets flood rapidly, however, and it usually doesnâ€™t take more than a few
    merchant trips to persuade the locals to demand trade goods or credits.
