  description: >-
    Lazarus patch: A vital tool for adventurers, the lazarus patch is a heavy
    compress laced with antibiotics, coagulants, system stabilizers, plasma, and
    a oneshot diagnostic suite. If the patch is applied to a character that has
    fallen to 0 hit points, the user can make an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill
    check against difficulty 6 to stabilize the subject. The more time between
    injury and application, the less chance the patch has to work. Each round
    after the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the skill check. The
    patch is no use after six rounds. If the medic fails the first skill check,
    they can keep trying the check once per round until the victim is revived or
    time runs out. Lazarus patches are no use on victims that have died of
    disease, poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy
    weapons or similar trauma. Only one patch can be applied to a victim.
    Revived victims are critically wounded until sufficient medical help has
    been tendered; see the Systems chapter for details.
