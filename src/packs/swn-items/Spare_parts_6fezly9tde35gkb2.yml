    Spare parts: This is a general category for a number of small TL4 components
    and repair materials. While a simple toolkit or metatool is often enough to
    fix a damaged object, severely broken devices may need replacement parts.
    Rather than keep a catalog of bits and pieces, a technician can simply bring
    along one or more units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM
    decides that a repair effort requires more than existing salvage can
    support. A unit of spare parts can also be used to jury-rig some basic,
    uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen
    minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such bodged devices rarely
    last longer than one scene.
