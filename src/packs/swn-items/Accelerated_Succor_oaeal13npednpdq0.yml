  description: >-
    <p>The biopsionâ€™s <em>Psychic Succor</em> now can be used as an On Turn
    power, albeit only once per round. By Committing an additional Effort for
    the day with each use, it can even be used as an Instant power, though it
    still can only be used once per round. Any surcharges for augmenting the
    succor apply normally, such as with <em>Tissue Integrity Field</em>.</p>
