  description: >-
    You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under
    stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.<br /><br />Level 1:
    You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per level. This bonus applies
    retroactively if you take this focus after first level. You automatically
    stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than a Heavy weapon.<br
    />Level 2: The first time each day that you are reduced to zero hit points
    by an injury, you instead survive with one hit point remaining. This ability
    canâ€™t save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.
