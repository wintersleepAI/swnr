  description: >-
    You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under
    stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.<br /><br />Level 1:
    You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per level. This bonus applies
    retroactively if you take this focus after first level. You automatically
    stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than a Heavy weapon.<br
    />Level 2: The first time each day that you are reduced to zero hit points
    by an injury, you instead survive with one hit point remaining. This ability
    can’t save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.
