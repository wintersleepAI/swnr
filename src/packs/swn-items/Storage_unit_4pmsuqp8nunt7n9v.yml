  description: >-
    Storage unit: While conventional dataslabs have ample space to hold any
    reasonable amount of data, sometimes a party needs to store or acquire a
    truly huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a portable but clumsy
    case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm,
    capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload
    data. A single storage unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that has
    been carefully compressed and optimized for it. If the user is simply
    ripping a database off a network and stuffing it into the unit, it can
    absorb up to a small corporation’s complete files.
