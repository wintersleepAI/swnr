  description: >-
    Trade goods: Glowbugs, ceramic fire lighters, antibiotics, ceraplast tools,
    and the other fruits of a TL4 civilization that might be valuable on more
    primitive worlds. A kilo of trade goods can usually be traded for at least a
    hundred credits worth of local products on more primitive worlds that are
    not well-served by interstellar merchants. The profit margin shrinks rapidly
    as interstellar trade becomes more common, and there is always the
    difficulty of finding local products that are actually worth a merchantâ€™s
    journey.
