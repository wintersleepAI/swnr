  description: >-
    A  weapon  or  defense may require  ammunition   to fire.  This fitting can
    be used to represent a full payload. You should edit the name or description
    to capture the type and count.

    From the book: Each round’s cost is listed after the weapon’s   cost,  and 
    a  number  of  rounds  equal  to  the   weapon’s  Ammo  rating  can  be 
    fit  into  one  free   mass unit. For example, a torpedo launcher can fit 
    the magazine and loading gear for four torpedoes  into one free mass unit,
    and each torpedo will cost  2,500 credits. For each ship class larger than
    the  minimum required to mount the weapon, double  the stored ammo per unit.
    The weapon itself in- cludes  one  free  mass  unit  worth  of  ammunition  
    as part of the installation, so simply mounting a  torpedo launcher alone on
    a frigate gives the ship  four rounds of ammo.
  effect: Reload a weapon or defense that uses this ammo type.
