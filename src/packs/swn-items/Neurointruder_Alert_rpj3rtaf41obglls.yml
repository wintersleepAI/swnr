  description: >-
    While somewhat primitive by pretech standards, this TL5 cybernetic implant
    allows the wearer to gain a +3 bonus on all saving throws to resist
    telepathic intrusion. Even if such a save is failed, the user will be aware
    that they are under telepathic assault, though some forms of mental control
    may not allow them to say as much until after the influence is ended. The
    warning does not indicate the source of the influence.
