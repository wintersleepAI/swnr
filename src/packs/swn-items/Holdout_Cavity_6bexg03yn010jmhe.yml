  description: >-
    Usually implanted somewhere in the torso, a holdout cavity is a small recess
    shaped into the wearer’s body and designed to be overlooked by most standard
    forms of medical or security scanning. It automatically defeats a security
    inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and even advanced tech requires
    careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it. The cavity can
    hold an object up to the size of a pistol and is opened and shut by the
    user’s mental command.
