  description: >-
    The ship has been fitted with specialized mounts, bunking, cargo bays, and
    other facilities to expedite the transport of often unwieldy vehicles,
    including including mechs and other military craft. Any vehicles carried
    count as only half their usual cargo tonnage. Assuming trained operators, up
    to four vehicles can be offloaded or ramped onto the ship per round in cases
    where speed is critical.
