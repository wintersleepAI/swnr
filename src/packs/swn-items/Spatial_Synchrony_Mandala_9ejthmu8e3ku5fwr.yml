  description: >-
    <p>The psychic imprints a particular object or person on their psionic
    awareness. Provided the object is relatively intact and in range of their
    <em>Personal Apportation</em>, the psychic always knows its exact location
    and can teleport to within three meters of it with <em>Personal
    Apportation</em> even if it has moved from its original location. Imprinting
    an object requires an hourâ€™s meditation with it, and only one object can be
    imprinted at a time. If imprinting on a person, the target must be willing
    and cooperative to make the imprint. Objects must be at least one kilogram
    in mass to be effectively tracked.</p>
