  description: >-
    Some people simply cannot afford to be out of contact at any time, under any
    circumstances. Those people find use for the microfine web of radio wiring
    and optical augmentation that make up the ghost talker. These units act as a
    built-in compad for the user and allow for reception and transmission of
    audio and visual recordings, the latter playing in an inset window in the
    userâ€™s field of vision. If the unit is operating outside of a standard comm
    grid, it has a transmission range of twenty kilometers and a reception range
    of one hundred. Ghost talker users can transmit basic visual diagrams and
    images to each other, as well as optical recordings.
