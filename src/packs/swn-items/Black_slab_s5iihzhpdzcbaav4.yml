    Black slab: While a “black slab” appears to be a normal dataslab to casual
    examination, these devices are packed with intrusion-optimization hardware
    and integral line tapping tools. They function as a metatool for purposes of
    accessing data lines and grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made with
    them. They are also quite illegal on most worlds, available only from black
    market dealers and private sales from hackers.
