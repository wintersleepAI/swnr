  description: >-
    <p>The metapsion’s abilities can be reinforced with a degree of
    metadimensional energy that would cause substantial damage to a less adept
    mind. Particularly weak or unprepared minds might be completely crushed by
    the force of the adept’s augmented will.</p><p>The adept must Commit Effort
    for the day when using a power that normally grants its target a saving
    throw. The target then suffers a penalty equal to the adept’s Metapsionics
    skill on any saving throw normally granted by the power. If the target’s hit
    die total or character level is less than half the adept’s level, rounded
    up, they automatically fail their saving throw.</p>
