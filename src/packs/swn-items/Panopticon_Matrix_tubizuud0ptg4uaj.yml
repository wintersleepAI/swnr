    These facilities weave braked-AI intelligence analysts into a web of
    observation capable of detecting the slightest evidence of intruders on a
    world. Every rival Stealthed asset on the planet must succeed in a Cunning
    vs. Cunning test at the beginning of every turn or lose their Stealth. The
    owner also gains an additional die on all Cunning attacks and defenses on
    that planet.
