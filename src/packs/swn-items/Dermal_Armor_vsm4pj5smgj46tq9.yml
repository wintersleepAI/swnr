  description: >-
    A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection
    against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to anything short of
    a medical examination. Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune to
    Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee weapons. A TL5 version of this
    implant that costs five times as much grants even more protection, rendering
    the subject wholly immune to primitive weapons as if they were wearing
    powered armor.
