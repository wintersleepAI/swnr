  description: >-
    An armored vacc suit has traded off some comfort and flexibility for
    additional protective thickness. Aside from functioning as a normal vacc
    suit, it has only half the usual chance to tear when hit by an edged weapon
    or suit ripper. The choice between armored or standard suits is a common
    debate in spacer bars.
