  description: >-
    You have a tremendous natural talent for ship combat, and can make any
    starship you captain a significantly more fearsome opponent. You must take
    the captainâ€™s role during a fight as described on page 117 of the Ship
    Combat rules in order to benefit from this focus.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain
    Lead as a bonus skill. Your ship gains 2 extra Command Points at the start
    of each turn.<br />Level 2: A ship you captain gains bonus hit points equal
    to 20% of its maximum at the start of each combat. Damage is taken from
    these bonus points first, and they vanish at the end of the fight and do not
    require repairs to replenish before the next. In addition, once per
    engagement, you may resolve a Crisis as an Instant action by explaining how
    your leadership resolves the problem.
