  description: >-
    <p>The biopsion has mastered techniques of emergency tissue reinforcement
    and system stabilization. As an Instant action, they can Commit Effort for
    the scene to keep themself or a target they can touch active even at zero
    hit points. This technique must be used once every round on the target or
    they collapse at the end of the round. If the target suffers hit point
    damage, the biopsion must Instantly Commit Effort for the scene or the
    target goes down immediately with a mortal wound. A Heavy weapon hit on a
    subject of this power or similar physical dismemberment will always kill a
    target, regardless of this technique.</p>
