  description: >-
    Deployed to confuse enemy factions into untimely investments. As an action,
    the marketers may test Cunning vs. Wealth against a rival faction's asset.
    If successful, the target faction must immediately pay half the asset's
    purchase cost, rounded down, or have it become disabled and useless until
    this price is paid.
