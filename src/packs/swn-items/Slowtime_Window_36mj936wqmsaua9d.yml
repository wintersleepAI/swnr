  description: >-
    A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the slowtime window was installed
    in crisis responders and others reliant on split-second decision making.
    When engaged, the implants accelerate the user’s cogitation speed by more
    than three thousand percent. While there is no corresponding acceleration of
    the user’s physical reflexes, they have time to process the situation and
    take in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime window cannot be
    surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how unexpected
    the attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful on the tissues,
    however, and one point of System Strain is gained each time it is engaged.
