  description: >-
    <p>The biopsion can now shape their own or another willing target’s physical
    form as a Main Action, transforming a touched target into any humanoid form
    within 50% of their own mass. Claws and other body armaments can be
    fashioned equivalent to Light or Medium melee weapons and innate armor
    equivalent to AC 13. Gills and other environmental-survival alterations are
    also viable at the GM’s discretion, but flight is a bridge too far for this
    power.</p><p>A person can be impersonated down to the DNA level, provided a
    blood or hair sample is available. The use of this adds one System Strain
    point to the target that does not recover so long as the change is in
    effect. Applying <em>Metamorph</em> requires that the biopsion Commit Effort
    for as long as the change is to be maintained. If applied to a target other
    than the psychic, the power automatically ends if the psychic gets more than
    one hundred kilometers away.</p>
