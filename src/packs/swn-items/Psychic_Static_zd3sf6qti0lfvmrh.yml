  description: >-
    <p>As an Instant action, the metapsion may Commit Effort for the day to
    negate a perceived psychic power. The psychic responsible for the effect
    must Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to resist this negation,
    otherwise the power ends and any action used to trigger it is wasted. The PC
    may then Commit Effort for the day again, with each spending and
    counter-spending until one runs out of Effort or chooses to stop.
    <em>Psychic Static</em> can be applied only once per round to any particular
    power. The target of the <em>Psychic Static</em> automatically knows the
    position of the interfering metapsion, though other onlookers do not have
    any obvious way of identifying the metapsion.</p>
