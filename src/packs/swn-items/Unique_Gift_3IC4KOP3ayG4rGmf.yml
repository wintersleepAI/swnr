  description: >-
    Whether due to exotic technological augmentation, a unique transhuman
    background, or a remarkable human talent, you have the ability to do
    something that’s simply impossible for a normal human. This is a special
    focus which serves as a catch-all for some novel power or background perk
    that doesn’t have a convenient fit in the existing rules. A transhuman who
    can function normally in lethal environments, a nanotech-laden experimental
    subject with a head full of exotic sensors, or a brilliant gravitic
    scientist who can fly thanks to their personal tech might all take this
    focus to cover their special abilities. It’s up to the GM to decide what’s
    reasonable and fair to be covered under this gift. If an ability is
    particularly powerful, it might require the user to take System Strain to
    use it, as described on page 32. As a general rule this ability should be
    better than a piece of gear the PC could buy for credits. The player is
    spending a very limited resource when they make this focus pick, so what
    they get should be good enough that they can’t just duplicate it with a fat
    bank account.<br /><br />Level 1: <br />Level 2:
