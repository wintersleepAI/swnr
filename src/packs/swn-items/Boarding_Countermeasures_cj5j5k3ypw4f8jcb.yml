  description: >-
    The ship has hardened bulkheads, reinforced hatches, and specially-designed
    automated kill corridors for wiping out intruders. Provided that the ship's
    bridge is still under control, the operator can prevent entry to the ship by
    any force that lacks shipyard-grade tools, weapons capable of melting hull
    plating, or specialized military breaching implements. If intruders do get
    inside, only well-equipped, specially-trained marines have any real chance
    of breaching the defences. Ordinary space pirates or more casual invaders
    have only a 1 in 6 chance of threatening the bridge crew, though they may
    cause significant damage in their dying.
