  description: >-
    The ship’s standard drive-1 spike drive is removed and replaced with a
    different propulsion system. The ship is still treated as having a drive-1
    for maneuvering and system transit purposes, but it cannot make interstellar
    drills. This modification  lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and adds
    extra power and space based on the size of the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2
    for frigates, 3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this
    amount of free mass is gained by the process.
