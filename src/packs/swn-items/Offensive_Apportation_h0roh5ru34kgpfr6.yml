  description: >-
    <p>The psychic can use <em>Personal Apportation</em> as a Main Action to
    teleport an unwilling target, provided the user can make physical contact
    with them. Contact with an unsuspecting or incapacitated target is
    automatic, while touching a resisting enemy requires a Punch hit roll with a
    bonus equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill. If the psychic does not
    use the <em>Burdened Apportation</em> technique then only the target is
    teleported; otherwise the user may go along with them. The psychic cannot
    teleport a target to any location they could not teleport to, including
    locations of imminent environmental danger, such as high in the air, into a
    windowless tomb, or into the middle of a sea. A conscious, resisting target
    can make a Mental saving throw to forcibly abort the teleportation, rolling
    at a penalty equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill. Use of this
    technique adds to the cost of <em>Personal Apportation</em>, requiring the
    psychic Commit an additional point of Effort for the day whether the touch
    hits or not.</p>
