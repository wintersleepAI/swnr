  description: >-
    <p>Once a telepath has made a <em>Telepathic Contact</em> with a target,
    they can thereafter activate the technique whenever that target is within
    100 kilometers, whether or not the psychic knows where they are. At
    Telepathy-3 the range increases to 1,000 kilometers, and at Telepathy-4 it
    extends over an entire planet and up to orbital distances. This distant
    connection is tenuous, however, and the psychic cannot use any technique
    through it that would allow the target a saving throw to resist.</p>
