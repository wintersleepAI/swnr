  description: >-
    Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures an be used to forcibly
    invade a hostile ship, provided the target's engines have been disabled.
    Ships without boarding tubes have to send invaders across empty space to
    either make an assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded airlock or cut their
    way in through the hull with laser cutters and half an hour of work.
