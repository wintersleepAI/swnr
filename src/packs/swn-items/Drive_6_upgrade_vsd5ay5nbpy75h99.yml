  description: >-
    A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1 spike drive with additional
    phase filters and power throughput refinements. A captain needs to buy only
    the final grade of drive desired. He does not have to buy upgrades
    sequentially. Drives of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that
    cannot be built on most modern worlds.
