  description: >-
    Armored and stealthed version of cargo lighters, these craft are twice as
    fast, apply a -3 penalty to tracking and targeting skill checks, and can
    carry up to one hundred troops or passengers. Many are equipped with
    assorted Heavy weapons to clear the landing zone, and can be treated as
    flight-capable gravtaks for purposes of combat. This fitting can be
    purchased multiple times.
