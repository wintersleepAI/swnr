  description: >-
    <p>The precog instinctively wrenches the lines of probability away from
    futures in which they are about to die. This technique triggers
    automatically when the precog is about to die, provided they can Commit
    Effort for the day. On triggering, random events somehow conspire to leave
    the precog alive, even if outrageous coincidences and ridiculous luck are
    required. Provided the precog doesn’t intentionally thrust herself back into
    danger, their life is secured for the next few minutes at least, though
    there’s no guarantee the psychic will survive intact in mind or body. This
    technique can trigger no more often than once per week.</p>
