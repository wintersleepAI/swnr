  description: >-
    Most often found among military bot wranglers, civilians can also get a
    drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting of drones and
    other robotic units. Users of a link can issue commands to a drone as a Move
    action instead of a Main Action. A single drone can only receive one command
    per round, however. Aside from this ease of command, someone with an
    implanted rig can "look" through a piloted drone's sensors as an Instant
    action, and a drone is never considered to be out of control even if the
    pilot doesn't spend an action controlling it. A link can maintain a
    connection with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program skill.
