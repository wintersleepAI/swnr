  description: >-
    <p>Once per turn, as an On Turn action, the psychic can Commit Effort for
    the scene to create a telekinetic force construct at a visible point,
    provided it can fit within a three-meter cube. The force construct can be
    shaped in any way the psychic wishes, and can remain fixed in its location
    without external supports if desired. It is as sturdy as a TL4 construction
    and may be visible or invisible at the adeptâ€™s choice. The construct lasts
    until the end of the scene, until the psychic dispels it, or until it is
    smashed with 20 points of damage against AC 15.</p>
