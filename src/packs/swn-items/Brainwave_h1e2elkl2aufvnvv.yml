  description: >-
    Brainwave (Heal-2): This psitech drug requires advanced TL5 facilities to
    compound, and the few remaining doses from pre-Silence periods are rarely
    available on the open market. Application of Brainwave gives a psychic 2
    extra maximum Effort for one hour. At the end of that hour, they suffer 4
    points of System Strain. If their Strain is maximized by this, they go
    unconscious for one hour. Only one dose can be active at a time.
