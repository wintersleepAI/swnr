  description: >-
    Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road, they’ve mastered a
    number of tricks for ensuring their mobility and surviving the inevitable
    difficulties of a vagabond existence.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Survive as a
    bonus skill. You can convey basic ideas in all the common languages of the
    sector. You can always find free transport to a desired destination for
    yourself and a small group of your friends provided any traffic goes to the
    place. Finding this transport takes no more than an hour, but it may not be
    a strictly legitimate means of travel and may require working passage.<br
    />Level 2: You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers and identification
    for the party with 1d6 hoursof work. These papers and permits will stand up
    to ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/Administer versus
    Wis/Notice check if examined by an official while the PC is actually wanted
    by the state for some crime. When finding transport for the party, the
    transportation always makes the trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter
    would.
