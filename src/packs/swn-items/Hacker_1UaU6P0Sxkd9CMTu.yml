  description: >-
    You have a considerable fluency with digital security measures and standard
    encryption methods. You know how to make computerized systems obey you until
    their automatic failsafes come down on your control.<br /><br />Level 1:
    Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack a database or
    computerized system, roll 3d6 on the skill check and drop the lowest die.<br
    />Level 2: Your hack duration increases to 1d4+Program skill x 10 minutes.
    You have an instinctive understanding of the tech; you never need to learn
    the data protocols for a strange system and are always treated as familiar
    with it.
