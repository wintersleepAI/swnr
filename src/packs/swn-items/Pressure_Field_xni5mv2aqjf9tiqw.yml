    <p>As an Instant action, the adept can manifest a protective force skin
    around their person equivalent to a vacc suit, maintaining pressure and
    temperature even in hard vacuum conditions. They can ignore temperatures at
    a range of plus or minus 100 degrees Celsius and automatically pressurize
    thin atmospheres for breathability, or filter particulates or airborne
    toxins. By Committing Effort for the scene, they can shield up to six
    comrades. This lasts until the user reclaims the Effort.</p>
