  description: >-
    <p>The psychic can carry willing companions with them when using
    <em>Personal Apportation</em>. Up to three human-sized companions and their
    man-portable gear may be carried per skill level in Teleportation. Allies
    must be within 3 meters of the teleporter to be carried along. Ordinary
    inert matter cannot be carried along unless the psychic is touching it or
    it’s being carried by an ally affected by this power. If carrying inert
    mass, up to two hundred kilos of objects can be carried per
    skill</p><p>Level. Using this technique increases the Effort cost of
    <em>Personal Apportation</em>, requiring that an extra point of Effort be
    Committed for the day.</p>
