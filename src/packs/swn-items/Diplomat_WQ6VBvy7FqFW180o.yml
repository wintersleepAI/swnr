  description: >-
    You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can manipulate
    the attitudes of those around you. Even so, while smooth words are
    versatile, they’ll only work if your interlocutor is actually willing to
    listen to you.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Talk as a bonus skill. You speak all
    the languages common to the sector and can learn new ones to a workable
    level in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check
    dice related to negotiation or diplomacy.<br />Level 2: Once per game
    session, shift an intelligent NPC’s reaction roll one step closer to
    friendly if you can talk to them for at least thirty seconds.
