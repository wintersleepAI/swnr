  description: >-
    Tsunami (Heal-1): An emergency combat stim used to juice certain expendable
    soldiers before an assault, Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for
    pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short effect duration and difficult
    application limits its wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score of
    12, 10 extra hit points for ten minutes and a +2 bonus on all hit rolls. At
    the end of the duration, they immediately lose those 10 hit points, which
    may leave them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to
    the target.
