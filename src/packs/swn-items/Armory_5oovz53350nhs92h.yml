  description: >-
    Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can
    simply buy an armory. Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4
    military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew might require, and integral
    maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to
    outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving it away or losing it in
    use may deplete it.
