  description: >-
    The ship is designed with symbiosis mounts that allow other ships to "hitch"
    on the crat's spike drills. Each shiptender mount allows one craft of a hull
    size smaller than the tender to link up for intersystem drills. Mounts
    cannot be used for in-system travel. If the linking ship has been designed
    to be carried by a tender then establishing this link takes one hour. If
    not, it takes a full day to fit the ship into the mount. Ships can dismount
    from the tender with an hour's disentanglement. In an emergency, the carried
    ship can dismount instnatly, but the mountings are considered disable then
    until repairs are made. Carried ships cannot fight.
