  description: >-
    <p>As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for the scene just
    before they roll initiative. Their initiative score is treated as one better
    than anyone elseâ€™s involved in the scene. If another participant has this
    power or some other ability that grants automatic initiative success, roll
    initiative normally to determine which of them goes first, and then the rest
    of the combatants act. This ability cannot be used if the precog has been
    surprised.</p>
