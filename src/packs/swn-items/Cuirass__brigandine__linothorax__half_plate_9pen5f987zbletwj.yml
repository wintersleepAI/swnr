  description: >-
    Primitive armor is a catch-all covering all armor technology that lacks
    access to advanced materials and processes. While such armor can be very
    effective in protecting against primitive weaponry, it is useless against
    advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of all kinds. Against these weapons,
    it is treated as AC 10. Note that some planets have native flora or fauna
    capable of naturally producing extremely effective armor materials, ones not
    susceptible to this limitation
