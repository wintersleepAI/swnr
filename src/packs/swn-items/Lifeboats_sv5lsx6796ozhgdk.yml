  description: >-
    Selecting this fitting equips the ship with a number of single-use escape
    craft capable of reaching the nearest habitable planet or station in a star
    system. If no such destination exists, the boats can maintain their
    passengers for a year in drugged semi-stasis. Lifeboats have
    fully-functional comms systems and are usually equipped with basic survival
    supplies and distress beacons. A single selection of this fitting provides
    enough lifeboats for a ship's maximum crew, with up to twenty people per
    boat.
