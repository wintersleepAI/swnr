  description: >-
    You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in carrying
    out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on page 52.<br /><br
    />Level 1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no larger
    than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search,
    including normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can draw or produce this
    object as an On Turn action, and your point-blank ranged attacks made from
    surprise with it cannot miss the target.<br />Level 2: You can take a Move
    action on the same round as you make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly
    with a target before you attack. You may split this Move action when making
    an Execution Attack, taking part of it before you murder your target and
    part of it afterwards. This movement happens too quickly to alert a victim
    or to be hindered by bodyguards, barring an actual physical wall of meat
    between you and your prey.
