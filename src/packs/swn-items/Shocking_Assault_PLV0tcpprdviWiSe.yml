  description: >-
    You’re extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your melee
    attacks stresses and distractsenemies even when your blows don’t draw
    blood.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock
    damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10, assuming
    your weapon is capable of harming the target in the first place.<br />Level
    2: In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock damage rating of all melee
    weapons and unarmed attacks. Regular hits never do less damage than this
    Shock would do on a miss.
