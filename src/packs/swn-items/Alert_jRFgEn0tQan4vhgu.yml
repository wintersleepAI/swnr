  description: >-
    You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take
    unaware. You have an instinctive alacrity of response that helps you act
    before less wary persons can think to move.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Notice
    as a bonus skill. You cannot be surprised, nor can others use the Execution
    Attack option on you. When you roll initiative, roll twice and take the best
    result.<br />Level 2: You always act first in a combat round unless someone
    else involved is also this Alert.
