  description: >-
    All ships are equipped with basic medical facilities for curing lightly
    injured crew members and keeping the seriously injured ones stable until
    reaching a planet. An extended medbay improves those facilities, allowing
    for the medical treatment of up to the ship's entire maximum crew at once,
    including the treatment of critically wounded passengers.
