  description: >-
    Psych (None): A military drug duplicated in rougher form by many street
    chemists, Psych fills the user with an intense sense of confidence and
    reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their judgment regarding
    danger. A person affected by Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12
    and a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover during combat and
    cannot decide not to attempt a skill check after learning its difficulty.
    The effect lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the user, and is
    highly psychologically addictive.
