  description: >-
    You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to
    slugthrowers or energy weapons, it is also applicable to thrown weapons,
    bows, or other ranged weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For
    thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same
    time as Gunslinger.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can
    draw or holster a Stowed ranged weapon as an On Turn action. You may add
    your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon’s damage roll.<br />Level 2: Once
    per round you can reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action if it takes no
    more than one round to reload. Even on a miss with a Shoot attack, you do an
    unmodified 1d4 damage.
