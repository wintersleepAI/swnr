  description: >-
    Free mas can be traded for pressurized cargo space. Tracked by weight for
    convenience, one cubic meter is usually one ton, with most vehicles
    requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks taking 25, and aircraft or mechs
    taking up 50 tons of cargo space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons of
    cargo space in a fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200 tons in a cruiser and
    2000 tons in a capital-class ship. This fitting can be purchased multiple
    times.
