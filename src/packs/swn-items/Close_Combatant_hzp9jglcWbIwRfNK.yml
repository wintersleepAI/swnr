  description: >-
    You’ve had all too much practice at close-in fighting and desperate
    struggles with pistol or blade. You’re extremely skilled at avoiding injury
    in melee combat, and at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without
    fear of being knifed in passing.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain any combat skill
    as a bonus skill. You can use pistol-sized ranged weapons in melee without
    suffering penalties for the proximity of melee attackers. You ignore Shock
    damage from melee assailants, even if you’re unarmored at the time.<br
    />Level 2: The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if
    they were AC 10. The Fighting Withdrawal combat action is treated as an On
    Turn action for you and can be performed freely.
