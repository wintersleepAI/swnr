  description: 'Power cells: One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold electrical charges. These larger type B cells for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for the cells is substantially different, and they cannot be exchanged or recharge each other without a trained tech’s modifications or a converter unit. Power cells can be recharged off a ship’s power plant or other grid. Recharging requires 24 hours for a type B cell.'
