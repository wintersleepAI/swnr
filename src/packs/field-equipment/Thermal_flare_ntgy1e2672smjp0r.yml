  description: >-
    Thermal flare: If triggered in one mode, the flare burns with a bright white
    light for two hours, illuminating up to twenty meters around the holder. If
    the guidance fins are extended first, the flare launches up to 200 meters
    and explodes in a bright white flash. A launched flare does 1d6 damage to
    anyone it hits, though the clumsy flight gives a -4 penalty on any attempts
    to hit something with it.
