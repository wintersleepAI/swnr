  description: >-
    Vacc fresher: This three-kilo tube filters and compresses atmosphere to
    refill vacc suit oxygen tanks. It can extract oxygen from any atmosphere
    which contains it, even in the form of carbon dioxide. Refilling a standard
    vacc suit tank requires ten minutes of operation and consumes one type A
    power cell. Most vacc freshers are also equipped with an emergency hand
    crank power source, though it requires at least two hours of cranking.
