  description: >-
    Portabox: A small cube of ceraplast attached to an electronic keycard. When
    a type A power cell is inserted, the portabox immediately unfolds into a
    rigid locker with 1.5 x 1 x 1 meter dimensions. The portabox is air-tight
    and has a simple electronic lock which can only be opened with the keycard
    or a successful difficulty 8 Sneak or Fix skill check. Failing the check
    will cause the lock to short-circuit and seal the box until it can be cut
    open with a metatool or broken open with twenty points of damage.
