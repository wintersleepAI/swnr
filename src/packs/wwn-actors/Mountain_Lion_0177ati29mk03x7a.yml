  biography: >-
    Cautious hunters that usually avoid combat with humans unless starving or
    cornered. Great cats may be playful, but are quick to anger. They remain
    outdoors, rarely venturing deep underground. Have yellow-brown fur and
    favour mountains, deserts, and forests. Will occasionally venture into
    dungeons. Pursuit: Always pursue prey that flees. Favoured prey: Often
    develop a taste for a certain type of meat (this may include humans!),
    hunting that creature with preference. Inquisitive: May follow PCs out of
    curiosity.
