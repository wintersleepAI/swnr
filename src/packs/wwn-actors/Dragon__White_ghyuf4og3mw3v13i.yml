  biography: >-
    A proud, ancient race of gigantic, carnivorous, winged reptiles. There are
    many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of
    their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs,
    far from areas of human civilisation. Found in cold regions. Behaviour:
    Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them.
    Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties
    worthy of the honour. Pride: Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will
    always listen to flattery. Attack pattern: A dragon always attacks first
    with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks
    (equal chance of either). Breath weapon: Can be used up to three times per
    day. Unless noted otherwise, all caught in the area suffer damage equal to
    the dragon's current hit points (Evasion save for half). Shapes: Cloud: 50'
    long, 40' wide, 20' high. Cone: 2' wide at the mouth, 30' wide at far end.
    Line: 5' wide along whole length. Energy immunity: Unharmed by their own
    breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar
    attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and
    suffers half damage from fire ball spells.) Language and spells: Some
    dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is
    listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected
    magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells). Sleeping: The
    chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by
    subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus
    to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep! Subduing: Will surrender
    if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been
    defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath
    weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if
    the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued
    dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp. Age: The following stats
    describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less
    and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD
    more and twice as much treasure. Lairs: A dragon's treasure is always kept
    in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.
