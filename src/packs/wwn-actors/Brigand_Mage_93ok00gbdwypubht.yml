        Crossbows come in heavier varieties than the one listed, but such slow,
        bulky arbalests are rarely in the hands of adventurers. Reloading a
        crossbow of this size takes a full Main Action, but due to the
        simplicity of their operation, someone without Shoot-0 can still use
        them at no unskilled hit penalty.

        Duration: 6 turns + 1 per level Range: 120' This spell has three usages:
        Conjuring light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for
        reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
        object, in which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a
        creature: By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an
        Evasion save, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot
        attack. Cancelling darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see
        below). Reversed: Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical
        blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it
        may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.

        Duration: 1 turn Range: 150' This spell conjures a glowing dart of
        energy that the caster may choose to shoot at a visible target within

        Higher level casters: May conjure more missiles: two additional missiles

        three missiles at 6th&ndash;10th level, five missiles at 11th&ndash;15th

        Duration: 12 turns Range: 120' An immobile, translucent, wall of ice
        springs into existence. ▶ Size: The wall can be any size, and may be
        shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster desires, up to
        1,200 sq. ft. For example, it may be a straight wall or curved into a
        protective circle. ▶ Location: The wall must rest upon a solid surface
        and may not be evoked so that it appears where objects are. ▶ Monsters
        with fewer than 4 HD: Cannot pass the wall of ice. ▶ Monsters with 4 or
        more HD: Can break through the wall, but suffer 1d6 hit points of damage
        when doing so. The wall deals double damage to creatures that use fire
        or are accustomed to fire.

        Duration: Instant Range: 10' The caster or a chosen creature vanishes
        and reappears at a location of the caster's choosing. ▶ Gear: The
        subject is teleported with all its gear, up to its maximum load. ▶
        Unwilling subjects: May make a Mental save to prevent the teleportation.
        ▶ Destination: May be at any distance, but must be known to the caster.
        The destination must be an open space at ground level. (It is not
        possible to intentionally teleport the subject into mid-air or into
        solid matter.) ▶ Risk: There is a risk, when teleporting, of
        accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a
        successful teleportation depends on the caster's knowledge of the
        destination (see right). Roll d% and consult the table below. Knowledge
        of Destination Ground Level Too High Too Low Scant 01-50 51-75 76-100
        Moderate 01-80 81-90 91-100 Exact 01-95 96-99 100 Ground level: The
        subject appears at the desired destination. Too high: The subject
        appears 1d10&times;10' above the intended destination. Should this
        location already be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly
        killed. Otherwise, the subject falls from a height. Too low: The subject
        appears in the ground and is killed instantly. Knowledge of destination:
        The caster's knowledge of the destination is rated as follows: ▶ Scant:
        A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by
        magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions. ▶ Moderate: A
        location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying
        for several weeks. ▶ Exact: A location that the caster has made a
        detailed study of, in person.
