        Crossbows come in heavier varieties than the one listed, but such slow,

        Duration: 6 turns + 1 per level Range: 120' This spell has three usages:
        Conjuring light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for
        reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
        object, in which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a
        creature: By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an
        Evasion save, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot
        attack. Cancelling darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see
        below). Reversed: Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical
        blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it
        may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.

      description: >-
        Duration: Instant Range: 10' The caster or a chosen creature vanishes
        and reappears at a location of the caster's choosing. ▶ Gear: The
        subject is teleported with all its gear, up to its maximum load. ▶
        Unwilling subjects: May make a Mental save to prevent the teleportation.
        ▶ Destination: May be at any distance, but must be known to the caster.
        The destination must be an open space at ground level. (It is not
        possible to intentionally teleport the subject into mid-air or into
        solid matter.) ▶ Risk: There is a risk, when teleporting, of
        accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a
        successful teleportation depends on the caster's knowledge of the
        destination (see right). Roll d% and consult the table below. Knowledge
        of Destination Ground Level Too High Too Low Scant 01-50 51-75 76-100
        Moderate 01-80 81-90 91-100 Exact 01-95 96-99 100 Ground level: The
        subject appears at the desired destination. Too high: The subject
        appears 1d10&times;10' above the intended destination. Should this
        location already be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly
        killed. Otherwise, the subject falls from a height. Too low: The subject
        appears in the ground and is killed instantly. Knowledge of destination:
        The caster's knowledge of the destination is rated as follows: ▶ Scant:
        A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by
        magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions. ▶ Moderate: A
        location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying
        for several weeks. ▶ Exact: A location that the caster has made a
        detailed study of, in person.

        summoned from an elemental plane of the caster's choice (air, earth,
        fire, water) to do the caster's bidding. ▶ Materials: The summons
        requires a large volume of the appropriate element. ▶ Concentration: Is
        required to command an elemental. ▶ Dismissing: While control over the
        elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending
        it back to its plane of origin. ▶ Disruption: If the caster moves at
        more than half speed or their concentration is disturbed, the command
        over the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a freewilled entity and will

        fingertips, filling a 30' diameter area. ▶ Movement: The fog moves at
        60' per turn (20' per round), driven by the wind (or away from the
        caster, in still conditions). ▶ Sinking: Because the fog is heavier than
        air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or
        sinkhole openings. ▶ Damage: All creatures in contact with the vapours
        suffer 1 hit point of damage per round of contact. ▶ Creatures with less
        than 5 Hit Dice: Must also make a physical save (once per round of
        contact) or die.
