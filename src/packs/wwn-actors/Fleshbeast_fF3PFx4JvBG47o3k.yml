  biography: >-
    These blind, sluglike, pig-sized crawlers are soft and harmless, snuffling
    at the vegetation with soft mouths that occasionally speak random phrases of
    the local language. They grow from spores spread during their roaming, and
    while their flesh is nutritious, the gelatinous consistency and unpleasantly
    human-like habits of speech that fleshbeasts have discourage some from
    eating their meat.
