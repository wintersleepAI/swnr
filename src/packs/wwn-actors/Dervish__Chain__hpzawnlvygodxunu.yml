        Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of
        costlier metal, can be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to
        hold and manipulate objects with that hand, albeit not wield a weapon
        with it. Larger shields are of cheaper wood and require a good grip. A
        small shield user has a base AC of 13, while a large shield user has a
        base AC of 14. Unlike other armor, however, if the user is already
        wearing equal or better armor the shield grants a +1 bonus to their AC.
        Shields allow the bearer to ignore the first instance of Shock they
        might otherwise suffer in a round.

        Spears, and their longer cousin the pike, are common military weapons
        throughout the Latter Earth. Lighter spears are effective thrown
        weapons, while heavier two-handed versions penetrate armor well.

    system:
      description: >-
        Mail shirts are usually of iron or steel wire, though bronze and other
        more exotic materials are not unknown. Such shirts cover only the vitals
        of the wearer, but are much less burdensome than a full hauberk. Medium
        armor is significantly noisier and more overt; it cannot be worn
        discreetly and applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any physical
        Sneak rolls made by the wearer.
