      description: >-
        Mail shirts are usually of iron or steel wire, though bronze and other
        more exotic materials are not unknown. Such shirts cover only the vitals
        of the wearer, but are much less burdensome than a full hauberk. Medium
        armor is significantly noisier and more overt; it cannot be worn
        discreetly and applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any physical
        Sneak rolls made by the wearer.

    system:
      description: >-
        Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of metal,
        can be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to hold and
        manipulate objects with that hand. Larger shields require the use of a
        gripping hand, but are usually of cheaper, lighter wood. A small shield
        user has a base AC of 13, while a large shield user has a base AC of 14.
        Unlike other armor, however, if the user is already wearing equal or
        better armor the shield grants a +1 bonus to their AC. Shields allow the
        bearer to ignore the first instance of Shock they might otherwise suffer
        in a round.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
