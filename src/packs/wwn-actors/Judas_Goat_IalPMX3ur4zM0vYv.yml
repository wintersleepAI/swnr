  biography: >-
    A goat the size of a cow and possessed of an elaborate fan of very sharp
    horns, the Judas goat is unusual in that its preferred browse is the
    xenoformed plant life of an arratu. Over the course of decades a flock of
    Judas goats can gradually push back a mild arratu's borders. Their flesh is
    toxic to predators and they are highly aggressive toward anything perceived
    as a threat to the flock. Only their hair is of any use to humans, but
    unusually skilled and brave goatherds can train them as watchbeasts or even
    as mounts.
