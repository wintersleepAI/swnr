    A Jikegida wearing a construction exoskeleton gains 20 hit points, a +2
    bonus to hit, and a +2 bonus on all damage rolls or Shock. Many exoskeletons
    incorporate the natural defenses or abilities of the creatures used in their
    construction, with poison sprays, tremendous mobility, sonic shrieks, or
    other offensive or defensive abilities. Two attacks per round. Shock ignores
    AC value.

    system:
      description: >-
        Grand plate is so finely-jointed that a weapon must either be very large
        or very armor-piercing to harm the wearer; they're immune to non-magical
        melee or thrown weapons unless the weapon is two-handed, has a Shock
        rating of AC 16 or more, or the wearer is currently grappled by someone
        as per the rules on page 43. This tight protection comes at the cost of
        the thick plating found in great armor or conventional plate. Heavy
        armor is the thickest, toughest panoply available on the market, and its
        bulk and noise make its encumbrance apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert
        checks made by the wearer.

  - name: Shield, Small

    system:
      description: >-
        Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of
        costlier metal, can be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to
        hold and manipulate objects with that hand, albeit not wield a weapon
        with it. Larger shields are of cheaper wood and require a good grip. A
        small shield user has a base AC of 13, while a large shield user has a
        base AC of 14. Unlike other armor, however, if the user is already
        wearing equal or better armor the shield grants a +1 bonus to their AC.
        Shields allow the bearer to ignore the first instance of Shock they
        might otherwise suffer in a round.
