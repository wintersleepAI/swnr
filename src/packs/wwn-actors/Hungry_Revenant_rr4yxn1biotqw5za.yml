    On the Spells tab (and duplicated on the Attributes tab) are certain special
    abilities or traits found in certain undead. Others surely exist. By
    default, undead cannot be poisoned, diseased, or be made to sleep or fall
    unconscious. They need not eat, drink, or breathe, and they are indifferent
    to normal extremes of heat or cold. Common undead are destroyed at zero hit
    points; PCs or powerful undead automatically stabilize. They do not continue
    to decay beyond their initial state, but self-repair at normal healing
    rates. Conventional healing spells or powers are useless on them unless used
    by themselves, a Necromancer, or by another person skilled in the
    maintenance of dead flesh. They accrue and lose System Strain as normal.
