    position. Orc chieftain: A 4HD (15hp) chieftain rules an orc tribe. The
    chieftain gains a +2 bonus to damage rolls. Giant companions: For every 20
    orcs, there is a 1-in-6 chance of an ogre (see left). accompanying them.
    There is a 1-in-10 chance of a troll (Troll, p120) living in the lair.

    leaders command them not to. Each tribe has its own lair and has as many
    females as males, and two whelps per two adults. Mercenaries: Orcs may be
    hired to fight in Chaotic armies. They delight in wanton killing and razing
    of settlements.

  system:
    description: >-
      Bows cover everything from the small self bows of horse archers to the
      man-tall longbows wielded by foot archers. Larger bows are more
      cumbersome and impossible to shoot from horseback, but usually have
      superior strength. An archer with a Readied quiver can load a fresh
      arrow as a Move action each turn, or as an On Turn action if they have
      at least Shoot-1 skill.

      Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
      forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
      cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.

  system:
    description: >-
      Axes given here are those fashioned for war; lighter and more agile than
      their working cousins, though still capable of hacking through a door or
      hewing a cable if needed. War axes are big enough to demand two hands
      for their use.

      Spears, and their longer cousin the pike, are common military weapons
      throughout the Latter Earth. Lighter spears are effective thrown
      weapons, while heavier two-handed versions penetrate armor well.

      Clubs, staffs, and maces are of much the same genus, though the latter
      is usually made of metal. While fully capable of killing a man, a
      careful user can usually avoid inflicting lethal injury.
