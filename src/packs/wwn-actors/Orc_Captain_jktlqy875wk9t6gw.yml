    delight in killing. Weapons: Prefer axes, clubs, spears, or swords. Only
    leaders can use mechanical weapons (e.g. crossbows, catapults). Leader:

    damage rolls. Leaders have defeated other orcs in combat to gain their
    position. Orc chieftain: A 4HD (15hp) chieftain rules an orc tribe. The
    chieftain gains a +2 bonus to damage rolls. Giant companions: For every 20
    orcs, there is a 1-in-6 chance of an ogre (see left). accompanying them.
    There is a 1-in-10 chance of a troll (Troll, p120) living in the lair.
    Tribal: Orcs of different tribes may fight among themselves, unless their
    leaders command them not to. Each tribe has its own lair and has as many
    females as males, and two whelps per two adults. Mercenaries: Orcs may be
    hired to fight in Chaotic armies. They delight in wanton killing and razing
    of settlements.

        Bows cover everything from the small self bows of horse archers to the
        man-tall longbows wielded by foot archers. Larger bows are more
        cumbersome and impossible to shoot from horseback, but usually have
        superior strength. An archer with a Readied quiver can load a fresh
        arrow as a Move action each turn, or as an On Turn action if they have
        at least Shoot-1 skill.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many

        Axes given here are those fashioned for war; lighter and more agile than
        their working cousins, though still capable of hacking through a door or
        hewing a cable if needed. War axes are big enough to demand two hands
        for their use.
