        Plate armor is an extremely expensive suit of tailored metal pieces that
        cover both the vitals and the limbs of the wearer. Heavy armor is the
        thickest, toughest panoply available on the market, and its bulk and
        noise make its encumbrance apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert checks
        made by the wearer.

      description: >-
        Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of
        costlier metal, can be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to
        hold and manipulate objects with that hand, albeit not wield a weapon
        with it. Larger shields are of cheaper wood and require a good grip. A
        small shield user has a base AC of 13, while a large shield user has a
        base AC of 14. Unlike other armor, however, if the user is already
        wearing equal or better armor the shield grants a +1 bonus to their AC.
        Shields allow the bearer to ignore the first instance of Shock they
        might otherwise suffer in a round.
