  biography: >-
    A proud, ancient race of gigantic, carnivorous, winged reptiles. There are
    many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of
    their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs,
    far from areas of human civilisation. Dwell in hills and mountains.
    Behaviour: Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes
    capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons
    may aid parties worthy of the honour. Pride: Dragons are immensely proud
    creatures and will always listen to flattery. Attack pattern: A dragon
    always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or
    makes melee attacks (equal chance of either). Breath weapon: Can be used up
    to three times per day. Unless noted otherwise, all caught in the area
    suffer damage equal to the dragon's current hit points (Evasion save for
    half). Shapes: Cloud: 50' long, 40' wide, 20' high. Cone: 2' wide at the
    mouth, 30' wide at far end. Line: 5' wide along whole length. Energy
    immunity: Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof.
    Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon
    is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)
    Language and spells: Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus
    Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also
    cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of
    spells). Sleeping: The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on
    the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for
    one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be
    asleep! Subduing: Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks,
    admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the
    damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape
    or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a
    suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp.
    Age: The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons
    may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure. Older
    dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure. Lairs: A
    dragon's treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom
    unguarded.
