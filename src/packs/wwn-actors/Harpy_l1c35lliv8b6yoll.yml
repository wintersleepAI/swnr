        Anyone who hears the song of a group of harpies must save or be charmed:
        move towards the harpies (resisting those who try to prevent it); defend
        the harpies; obey the harpies' commands (if understood); unable to cast
        spells or use magic items; unable to harm the harpies. A character who
        saves is unaffected for the rest of the encounter. Killing the harpies
        breaks the charm.

        Clubs, staves, and maces are of much the same genus, though the latter
        is usually made of metal. While fully capable of killing a man, a
        careful user can usually avoid inflicting lethal injury.
