        Energy Drain: A successfully hit target must save or gain 1d6 system
        strain. If this would take the target over their maximum, they instead
        permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss
        of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the
        drained level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is
        reduced to halfway between the former and new levels. A person drained
        of all levels becomes a wight in 1d4 days, under the control of the
        wight that killed them.
