        light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but
        is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in
        which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a creature: By
        casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it
        is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling
        darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed:
        Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing
        normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be
        used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.
