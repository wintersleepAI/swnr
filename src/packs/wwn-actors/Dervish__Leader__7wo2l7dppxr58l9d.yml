        Battle: Allies within a 20' square area who are not yet in melee gain a
        +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a +1 bonus to morale. Ritual:
        Casting bless may also form part of rituals of purification or
        consecration, at the referee's discretion. Reversed: Blight Incurs a

        enemies within a 20' square area. A save versus spells is allowed to
        resist the blight.

        Duration: Permanent Range: 120' This spell has three usages: 1.
        Conjuring light: In a 30' radius. The magical light is as bright as full
        daylight (creatures that suffer attack penalties in daylight are
        affected). The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the
        light moves with the object. 2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
        spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it is blinded.
        A blind creature cannot attack. 3. Cancelling darkness: Continual light
        may cancel a continual darkness spell (see below). Reversed: Continual
        Darkness Creates a 30' radius area of magical blackness, preventing both
        normal sight and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of
        darkness do not illuminate it. Like continual light, it may
        alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a continual light
        spell.

        Duration: Until quest is completed / Instant (remove quest) Range: 30'
        The caster commands a single subject to perform a specific quest or
        task. ▶ Examples: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster,
        bringing a magic item to the caster, or going on a journey to a holy
        site. ▶ Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest must not be obviously
        suicidal. ▶ Saving throw: The subject may make a Mental save, with
        success indicating that the quest has no effect. ▶ Refusal: Otherwise,
        the subject must undertake the quest or fall under a curse (per the
        curse spell, with the exact nature of the curse determined by the
        referee). ▶ Completion: Once the task is completed, the spell ends.
        Reversed: Remove Quest Can dispel an active quest spell. If the
        character who cast the quest spell to be nullified is higher level than
        the character casting remove quest, there is a chance of the spell
        having no effect. The probability of failure is 5% per level the caster

        Duration: Instant Range: 120' This spell has two uses: 1. Restore life:
        To a recently deceased human or demihuman. See below. 2. Destroy undead:
        A single undead monster is destroyed, if it fails a Physical save.
        Restoring life: When used to restore life, the following stipulations
        apply: ▶ Time limit: The caster can raise a person that has been dead
        for no longer than four days per level of the caster above 7th. For
        example, a 10th level caster can revive a character that has been dead
        for twelve days (three levels above 7th &times; four days). ▶ Weakness:
        Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two full weeks
        of bed rest, they are fragile, move at half the normal rate, cannot
        carry heavy items, and cannot attack, cast spells, or use other class
        abilities. This period of weakness may not be shortened by any magical
        healing. Reversed: Finger of Death Directs a ray of deadly magic at a
        single target. If the target fails a Physical save, it dies instantly.
        Casting finger of death is a chaotic act; it will only be used by lawful
        casters in desperate situations.

        Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of

        Duration: 12 turns Range: 180' A 15' radius area is rendered utterly
        silent. ▶ Within the area: All sound is stopped. Conversation and spell
        casting are impossible. ▶ Noise from outside the area: Can be heard by
        those within it. ▶ Casting upon a creature: Silence may be cast upon a
        creature, which must make a Mental save. If the save fails, the 15'
        radius area of silence moves with the creature. If the save succeeds,
        the spell's effect remains stationary&mdash;the targeted creature may
        move out of it.
