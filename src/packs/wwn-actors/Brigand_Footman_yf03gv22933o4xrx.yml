        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.

        Bows cover everything from the small self bows of horse archers to the
        man-tall longbows wielded by foot archers. Larger bows are more
        cumbersome and impossible to shoot from horseback, but usually have
        superior strength. An archer with a Readied quiver can load a fresh
        arrow as a Move action each turn, or as an On Turn action if they have
        at least Shoot-1 skill.

        Buff coats are long coats of thick, supple hide, sometimes worn to
        cushion the bite of heavier armor and sometimes sported as ornamented
        street clothing for the gentry who can afford such luxuries Light armor
        may be decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer
        minimal hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also
        discreet enough to be worn politely in common society.

    type: armor
    img: systems/wwn/assets/default/armor.png
    system:
      description: >-
        Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of metal,
        can be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to hold and
        manipulate objects with that hand. Larger shields require the use of a
        gripping hand, but are usually of cheaper, lighter wood. A small shield
        user has a base AC of 13, while a large shield user has a base AC of 14.
        Unlike other armor, however, if the user is already wearing equal or
        better armor the shield grants a +1 bonus to their AC. Shields allow the
        bearer to ignore the first instance of Shock they might otherwise suffer
        in a round.
