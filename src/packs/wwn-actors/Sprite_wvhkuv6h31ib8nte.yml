  biography: >-
    1' tall, winged humanoids, related to pixies and elves. They are shy, but
    driven by curiosity and their odd sense of humour. Curse: Five sprites can
    collectively curse a target (no attack roll; Mental save). The effect is
    determined by the referee, but will always be used to comical effect (e.g.
    target trips, target's nose grows). Pranksters: Even if attacked, sprites
    have no interest in killing, merely in making practical jokes.
