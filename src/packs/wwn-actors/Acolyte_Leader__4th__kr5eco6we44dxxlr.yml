        which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a creature: By

        is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling
        darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed:
        Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing
        normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be
        used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.

        Duration: 12 turns Range: 180' A 15' radius area is rendered utterly
        silent. ▶ Within the area: All sound is stopped. Conversation and spell
        casting are impossible. ▶ Noise from outside the area: Can be heard by
        those within it. ▶ Casting upon a creature: Silence may be cast upon a
        creature, which must make a Mental save. If the save fails, the 15'
        radius area of silence moves with the creature. If the save succeeds,
        the spell's effect remains stationary&mdash;the targeted creature may
        move out of it.

        Duration: 1d4+1 rounds or turns Range: 60' One or more snakes are
        rendered non-hostile, rearing up and swaying to and fro but not

        affect 7 HD of snakes, which can equal seven 1 HD snakes, or two 3 HD
        snakes and one 1 HD snake, or any other combination. ▶ Duration: When
        cast on snakes that are already attacking, the spell lasts for 1d4+1
        rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1d4+1 turns.
