    Dwell primarily in wild lands, but occasionally lairs in caves. Training: At
    the referee's discretion, captured cubs may be trained like dogs. Wolves are
    difficult to train. Strength in numbers: Packs of 4 or more wolves have
    morale 8. If the pack is reduced to less than 50% of its original size, this
    morale bonus is lost.
