      Energy Drain: A successfully hit target gains system strain equal to the
      damage inflicted; Shock does not count as a successful hit. If this
      would take the target over their maximum, they instead permanently loses
      one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of
      hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g.
      spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to the lowest
      amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels becomes a
      wraith in one day, under the control of the wraith that killed them.
