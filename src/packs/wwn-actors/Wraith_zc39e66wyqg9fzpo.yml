      description: >-
        A successfully hit target gains system strain equal to the damage
        inflicted; Shock does not count as a successful hit. If this would take
        the target over their maximum, they instead permanently loses one
        experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit
        points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g.
        spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to the lowest
        amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels becomes a
        wraith in one day, under the control of the wraith that killed them.
