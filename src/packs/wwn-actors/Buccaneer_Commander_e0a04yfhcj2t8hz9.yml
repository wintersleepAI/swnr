        Crossbows come in heavier varieties than the one listed, but such slow,
        bulky arbalests are rarely in the hands of adventurers. Reloading a
        crossbow of this size takes a full Main Action, but due to the
        simplicity of their operation, someone without Shoot-0 can still use
        them at no unskilled hit penalty.

        Mail shirts are usually of iron or steel wire, though bronze and other
        more exotic materials are not unknown. Such shirts cover only the vitals
        of the wearer, but are much less burdensome than a full hauberk. Medium
        armor is significantly noisier and more overt; it cannot be worn
        discreetly and applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any physical
        Sneak rolls made by the wearer.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
