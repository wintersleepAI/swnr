    Ships and crew: Depends where encountered. Rivers or lakes: 1d8 river boats
    (1d2 &times; 10 buccaneers each); coastal waters: 1d6 small galleys (1d3+1
    &times; 10 buccaneers each); any: 1d4 longships (1d3+2 &times; 10 buccaneers
    each); ocean: 1d3 small warships (1d5+3 &times; 10 buccaneers each). (See
    the Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome or use Worlds Without Number equivalents
    for ships.) Arms: 60% of group have: leather armour, sword; 30% have:
    leather armour, sword, crossbow; 10% have: chainmail, sword, crossbow.
    Leaders and captains: For every 30 buccaneers, there is a 4th level fighter.
    Each ship has a captain (7th level fighter). Fleet commander: 9th level
    fighter. 30% chance of a magic-user (level 1d2 + 9); 25% chance of a cleric
    (8th level). Treasure: Divided between vessels. Instead of carrying aboard,
    may have a map to where it is buried. Havens: Lawless, fortified, coastal
    towns may act as a haven for buccaneers and pirates.

        Mail shirts are usually of iron or steel wire, though bronze and other
        more exotic materials are not unknown. Such shirts cover only the vitals
        of the wearer, but are much less burdensome than a full hauberk. Medium
        armor is significantly noisier and more overt; it cannot be worn
        discreetly and applies its encumbrance as a penalty to any physical
        Sneak rolls made by the wearer.

        Crossbows come in heavier varieties than the one listed, but such slow,
        bulky arbalests are rarely in the hands of adventurers. Reloading a
        crossbow of this size takes a full Main Action, but due to the
        simplicity of their operation, someone without Shoot-0 can still use
        them at no unskilled hit penalty.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
