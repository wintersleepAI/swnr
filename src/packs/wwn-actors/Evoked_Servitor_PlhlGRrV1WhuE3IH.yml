  biography: >-
    Summmoned by a @UUID[Compendium.wwn.arts.Item.gGSkuSIXyMEEp02Q]{Calculation
    of the Evoked Servitor} spell. The familiar always adopts the same shape for
    the same caster, though the initial casting can set this to any shape the
    caster wishes provided it's no larger than a small human. The familiar
    retains a telepathic connection with its creator and will obey any command
    it is given, including suicidal ones. It can perform any action that a
    competent human servant could. If the familiar is slain, it fades away, but
    can be called forth again by the spell. The familiar retains its memories of
    what happens while it's summoned, and can develop its own personality in
    time. The familiar remains in existence until dawn following the spell's
    casting or until dismissed by the caster.
