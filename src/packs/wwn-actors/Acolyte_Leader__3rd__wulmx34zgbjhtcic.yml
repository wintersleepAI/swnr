        Duration: 12 turns Range: 120' This spell has three usages: Conjuring
        light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but
        is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in
        which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a creature: By
        casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it
        is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling
        darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed:
        Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing
        normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be
        used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.

        Duration: 12 turns Range: The caster This spell wards the caster from
        attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows: ▶ Bonuses: The
        caster gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special
        abilities of affected creatures. ▶ Affected creatures' attacks: Against

        above).
