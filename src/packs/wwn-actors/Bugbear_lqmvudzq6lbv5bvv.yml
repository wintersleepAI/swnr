        Clubs, staves, and maces are of much the same genus, though the latter
        is usually made of metal. While fully capable of killing a man, a
        careful user can usually avoid inflicting lethal injury.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
