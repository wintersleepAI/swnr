        Buff coats are long coats of thick, supple hide, sometimes worn to
        cushion the bite of heavier armor and sometimes sported as ornamented
        street clothing for the gentry who can afford such luxuries Light armor
        may be decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer
        minimal hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also
        discreet enough to be worn politely in common society.

        Crossbows come in heavier varieties than the one listed, but such slow,
        bulky arbalests are rarely in the hands of adventurers. Reloading a
        crossbow of this size takes a full Main Action, but due to the
        simplicity of their operation, someone without Shoot-0 can still use
        them at no unskilled hit penalty.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
