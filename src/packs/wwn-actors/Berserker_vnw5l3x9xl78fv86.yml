        Axes given here are those fashioned for war; lighter and more agile than
        their working cousins, though still capable of hacking through a door or
        hewing a cable if needed. War axes are big enough to demand two hands
        for their use.

        +2 to hit humans and similar humanoids (e.g. orcs, goblins). Rage
        sometimes makes them attack their allies. Note: This is figured into the
        Attack Bonus. Use a -2 situational penalty when the berserker is not
        raging or is attacking a non-humanoid.
