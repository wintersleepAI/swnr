  biography: >-
    Cautious hunters that usually avoid combat with humans unless starving or
    cornered. Great cats may be playful, but are quick to anger. They remain
    outdoors, rarely venturing deep underground. Large, solitary hunters with
    striped camouflage markings. Favour woodlands and cooler regions. Pursuit:
    Always pursue prey that flees. Favoured prey: Often develop a taste for a
    certain type of meat (this may include humans!), hunting that creature with
    preference. Inquisitive: May follow PCs out of curiosity. Surprise: On a
    1&ndash;4, in woodland, due to camouflage.
