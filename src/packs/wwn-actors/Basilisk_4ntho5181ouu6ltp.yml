  biography: >-
    10' long, serpentine lizards. Unintelligent, but highly magical. Dwell in
    caverns and twisted brambles. Surprise: Characters surprised by a basilisk
    meet its gaze. Petrifying touch: Anyone touched by a basilisk is turned to
    stone (Physical save). Petrifying gaze: Anyone meeting a basilisk's gaze is
    turned to stone (Evasion save). Unless averting eyes or using a mirror,
    characters in melee are affected each round. Averting eyes: &ndash;4 penalty
    to hit; the basilisk gains a +2 bonus to attack. Mirrors: The reflection of
    a basilisk is harmless. Fighting by looking in a mirror incurs a &ndash;1
    penalty to attack. If a basilisk sees its own reflection (2-in-6 chance), it
    must save or be petrified.
