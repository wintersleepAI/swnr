  biography: >-
    Cautious hunters that usually avoid combat with humans unless starving or
    cornered. Great cats may be playful, but are quick to anger. They remain
    outdoors, rarely venturing deep underground. High-speed hunters that live in
    plains and forests. Pursuit: Always pursue prey that flees. Favoured prey:
    Often develop a taste for a certain type of meat (this may include humans!),
    hunting that creature with preference. Inquisitive: May follow PCs out of
    curiosity.
