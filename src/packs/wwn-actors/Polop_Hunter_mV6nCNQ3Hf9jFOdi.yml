  biography: >-
    For their own equipment, Polop prefer to use living sea organisms sorceled
    into suitable weapons and scaly armor. Their "spitters" cough bone darts
    that function as thrown light spears, and the spears and slave-taking clubs
    they use are of a living coral. The weapons of their leaders sweat a venom
    that forces a victim that is struck to make a Physical save or lose their
    next turn's Main Action. Two failed saving throws in the same scene means
    the victim is paralyzed for the remainder of the scene. Add 2 to weapon
    damage and shock values.
