        Energy Drain: A successfully touched target gains 2d6 system strain. If
        this would take the target over their maximum, they instead permanently
        loses two experience levels (or Hit Dice). This incurs a loss of two Hit
        Dice of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained
        levels (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced
        to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels
        becomes a vampire in 3 days.
