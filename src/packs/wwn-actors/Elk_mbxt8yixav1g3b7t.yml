    Wild animals that live in large, grazing herds. The exact type depends on
    the terrain. Stampede: Herds of 20 or more can trample those in their path.
    3-in-4 chance each round. +4 to hit human-sized or smaller creatures. 1d20
    damage. Males: In groups of 3 or more, only 1-in-4 are males. These have 1d4
    extra hit points and protect the herd. Females and young: Flee from danger.
