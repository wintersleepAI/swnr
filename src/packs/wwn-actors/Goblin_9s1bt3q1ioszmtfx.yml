        Bows cover everything from the small self bows of horse archers to the
        man-tall longbows wielded by foot archers. Larger bows are more
        cumbersome and impossible to shoot from horseback, but usually have
        superior strength. An archer with a Readied quiver can load a fresh
        arrow as a Move action each turn, or as an On Turn action if they have
        at least Shoot-1 skill.

        Daggers come in ten thousand varieties, but the listed kind is a common
        fighting dirk, big enough to push through light armor while remaining
        small enough to be discreetly hidden. Stilettos and similar
        armor-piercing daggers aren't usually effective as thrown weapons.

        Spears, and their longer cousin the pike, are common military weapons
        throughout the Latter Earth. Lighter spears are effective thrown
        weapons, while heavier two-handed versions penetrate armor well.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
