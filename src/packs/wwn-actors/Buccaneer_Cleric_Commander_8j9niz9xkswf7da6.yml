    Sailors who make a living by raiding coastal settlements and robbing other
    ships. Typically ply rivers, lakes, and coastal waters; occasionally oceans.
    Ships and crew: Depends where encountered. Rivers or lakes: 1d8 river boats
    (1d2 &times; 10 buccaneers each); coastal waters: 1d6 small galleys (1d3+1
    &times; 10 buccaneers each); any: 1d4 longships (1d3+2 &times; 10 buccaneers
    each); ocean: 1d3 small warships (1d5+3 &times; 10 buccaneers each). (See
    the Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome or use Worlds Without Number equivalents
    for ships.) Arms: 60% of group have: leather armour, sword; 30% have:
    leather armour, sword, crossbow; 10% have: chainmail, sword, crossbow.
    Leaders and captains: For every 30 buccaneers, there is a 4th level fighter.
    Each ship has a captain (7th level fighter). Fleet commander: 9th level
    fighter. 30% chance of a magic-user (level 1d2 + 9); 25% chance of a cleric
    (8th level). Treasure: Divided between vessels. Instead of carrying aboard,
    may have a map to where it is buried. Havens: Lawless, fortified, coastal
    towns may act as a haven for buccaneers and pirates.

        Crossbows come in heavier varieties than the one listed, but such slow,

        them at no unskilled hit penalty.

        Duration: Until quest is completed / Instant (remove quest) Range: 30'
        The caster commands a single subject to perform a specific quest or
        task. ▶ Examples: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster,
        bringing a magic item to the caster, or going on a journey to a holy
        site. ▶ Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest must not be obviously
        suicidal. ▶ Saving throw: The subject may make a Mental save, with
        success indicating that the quest has no effect. ▶ Refusal: Otherwise,
        the subject must undertake the quest or fall under a curse (per the
        curse spell, with the exact nature of the curse determined by the
        referee). ▶ Completion: Once the task is completed, the spell ends.
        Reversed: Remove Quest Can dispel an active quest spell. If the
        character who cast the quest spell to be nullified is higher level than
        the character casting remove quest, there is a chance of the spell
        having no effect. The probability of failure is 5% per level the caster
        is below the caster of quest.

        Duration: Permanent Range: 120' This spell has three usages: 1.
        Conjuring light: In a 30' radius. The magical light is as bright as full
        daylight (creatures that suffer attack penalties in daylight are
        affected). The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the
        light moves with the object. 2. Blinding a creature: By casting the
        spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it is blinded.
        A blind creature cannot attack. 3. Cancelling darkness: Continual light
        may cancel a continual darkness spell (see below). Reversed: Continual
        Darkness Creates a 30' radius area of magical blackness, preventing both
        normal sight and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of
        darkness do not illuminate it. Like continual light, it may
        alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a continual light
        spell.
