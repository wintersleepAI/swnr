        Bows cover everything from the small self bows of horse archers to the
        man-tall longbows wielded by foot archers. Larger bows are more
        cumbersome and impossible to shoot from horseback, but usually have
        superior strength. An archer with a Readied quiver can load a fresh
        arrow as a Move action each turn, or as an On Turn action if they have
        at least Shoot-1 skill.

        Spears, and their longer cousin the pike, are common military weapons
        throughout the Latter Earth. Lighter spears are effective thrown
        weapons, while heavier two-handed versions penetrate armor well.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
