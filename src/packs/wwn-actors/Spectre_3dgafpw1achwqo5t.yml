        Energy Drain: A successfully hit target gains 1d8 system strain. If this
        would take the target over their maximum, they instead permanently loses
        two experience levels (or Hit Dice). This incurs a loss of two Hit Dice
        of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained levels
        (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to the
        lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels becomes
        a spectre next night, under the control of the spectre that killed them.
