        is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in

        is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling
        darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed:
        Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing
        normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be
        used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.

        Duration: 12 turns Range: 180' A 15' radius area is rendered utterly
        silent. ▶ Within the area: All sound is stopped. Conversation and spell
        casting are impossible. ▶ Noise from outside the area: Can be heard by
        those within it. ▶ Casting upon a creature: Silence may be cast upon a
        creature, which must make a Mental save. If the save fails, the 15'
        radius area of silence moves with the creature. If the save succeeds,
        the spell's effect remains stationary&mdash;the targeted creature may
        move out of it.

        Duration: 1d4+1 rounds or turns Range: 60' One or more snakes are
        rendered non-hostile, rearing up and swaying to and fro but not
        attacking. ▶ HD affected: The spell affects snakes whose total Hit Dice
        do not exceed the caster's level. For example, a 7th level caster can
        affect 7 HD of snakes, which can equal seven 1 HD snakes, or two 3 HD
        snakes and one 1 HD snake, or any other combination. ▶ Duration: When
        cast on snakes that are already attacking, the spell lasts for 1d4+1
        rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1d4+1 turns.

        Duration: 6 turns Range: 30' The caster can communicate with one type of
        animal within range when the spell is cast. ▶ Type of animal: Ordinary
        animals or giant versions of ordinary animals may be targeted. ▶
        Questions: The caster can ask questions of and receive answers from
        animals of the chosen kind, although the spell doesn't make animals any
        more friendly or cooperative than normal (a reaction roll may be
        required). ▶ Services: If an animal is friendly toward the caster, it
        may perform some favour or service.
