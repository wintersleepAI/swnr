        Battle: Allies within a 20' square area who are not yet in melee gain a
        +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a +1 bonus to morale. Ritual:
        Casting bless may also form part of rituals of purification or
        consecration, at the referee's discretion. Reversed: Blight Incurs a

        enemies within a 20' square area. A save versus spells is allowed to
        resist the blight.

        light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but
        is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in
        which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a creature: By
        casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it
        is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling
        darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed:
        Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing
        normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be
        used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.
