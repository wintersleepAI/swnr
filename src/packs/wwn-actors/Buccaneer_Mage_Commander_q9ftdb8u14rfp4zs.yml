    each); ocean: 1d3 small warships (1d5+3 &times; 10 buccaneers each). (See

    system:
      description: >-
        Duration: 6 turns + 1 per level Range: 120' This spell has three usages:
        Conjuring light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for
        reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
        object, in which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a
        creature: By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an
        Evasion save, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot
        attack. Cancelling darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see
        below). Reversed: Darkness Creates a 15' radius area of magical
        blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like light, it
        may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a light spell.

        Duration: 6 turns +1 per level Range: The caster The caster transforms
        themselves into another being: ▶ HD: The new form may not have higher
        Hit Dice than the caster's level. ▶ Stats: The caster retains their own
        intelligence, hit points, saving throws, and attack probabilities. ▶
        Physical capabilities: Of the new form (e.g. strength, physical attack
        forms, modes of movement) are acquired. ▶ Non-physical special
        abilities: (e.g. immunities, breath weapons, spell casting) are not
        acquired. ▶ Casting spells: While polymorphed, the caster is unable to
        cast spells. ▶ Specific individuals: The spell cannot be used to
        duplicate a specific individual. ▶ Reversion: If the caster dies while
        polymorphed, they return to their original form.

        type of creature, as chosen by the caster: ▶ HD: The spell fails if the
        new form's HD is more than twice the subject's HD. ▶ Hit points: The

        with behavioural patterns, tendencies, and intelligence. ▶ Specific
        individuals: The spell cannot be used to duplicate a specific

        effect.

        shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster desires, up to
        1,200 sq. ft. For example, it may be a straight wall or curved into a

        and may not be evoked so that it appears where objects are. ▶ Monsters
        with fewer than 4 HD: Cannot pass the wall of ice. ▶ Monsters with 4 or
        more HD: Can break through the wall, but suffer 1d6 hit points of damage
        when doing so. The wall deals double damage to creatures that use fire
        or are accustomed to fire.

      description: >-
        Duration: Instant Range: 10' The caster or a chosen creature vanishes
        and reappears at a location of the caster's choosing. ▶ Gear: The
        subject is teleported with all its gear, up to its maximum load. ▶
        Unwilling subjects: May make a Mental save to prevent the teleportation.
        ▶ Destination: May be at any distance, but must be known to the caster.
        The destination must be an open space at ground level. (It is not
        possible to intentionally teleport the subject into mid-air or into
        solid matter.) ▶ Risk: There is a risk, when teleporting, of
        accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a
        successful teleportation depends on the caster's knowledge of the
        destination (see right). Roll d% and consult the table below. Knowledge
        of Destination Ground Level Too High Too Low Scant 01-50 51-75 76-100
        Moderate 01-80 81-90 91-100 Exact 01-95 96-99 100 Ground level: The
        subject appears at the desired destination. Too high: The subject
        appears 1d10&times;10' above the intended destination. Should this
        location already be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly
        killed. Otherwise, the subject falls from a height. Too low: The subject
        appears in the ground and is killed instantly. Knowledge of destination:
        The caster's knowledge of the destination is rated as follows: ▶ Scant:
        A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by
        magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions. ▶ Moderate: A
        location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying
        for several weeks. ▶ Exact: A location that the caster has made a
        detailed study of, in person.

        elemental&mdash;a being formed of pure elemental matter&mdash;is
        summoned from an elemental plane of the caster's choice (air, earth,
        fire, water) to do the caster's bidding. ▶ Materials: The summons
        requires a large volume of the appropriate element. ▶ Concentration: Is
        required to command an elemental. ▶ Dismissing: While control over the
        elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending
        it back to its plane of origin. ▶ Disruption: If the caster moves at
        more than half speed or their concentration is disturbed, the command
        over the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a freewilled entity and will
        immediately try to kill the caster and any who get in its way. ▶

        fingertips, filling a 30' diameter area. ▶ Movement: The fog moves at
        60' per turn (20' per round), driven by the wind (or away from the
        caster, in still conditions). ▶ Sinking: Because the fog is heavier than
        air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or
        sinkhole openings. ▶ Damage: All creatures in contact with the vapours
        suffer 1 hit point of damage per round of contact. ▶ Creatures with less
        than 5 Hit Dice: Must also make a physical save (once per round of
        contact) or die.
