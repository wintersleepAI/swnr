  biography: >-
    A proud, ancient race of gigantic, carnivorous, winged reptiles. There are
    many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of
    their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs,
    far from areas of human civilisation. May be encountered in any terrain,
    often in the guise of a person or animal. Behaviour: Chaotic dragons usually
    try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may
    attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the
    honour. Pride: Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen
    to flattery. Attack pattern: A dragon always attacks first with its breath
    weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of
    either). Breath weapon: Can be used up to three times per day. Unless noted
    otherwise, all caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon's
    current hit points (Evasion save for half). Shapes: Cloud: 50' long, 40'
    wide, 20' high. Cone: 2' wide at the mouth, 30' wide at far end. Line: 5'
    wide along whole length. Energy immunity: Unharmed by their own breath
    weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack
    forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half
    damage from fire ball spells.) Language and spells: Some dragons are able to
    speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies.
    Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the
    listed number and level of spells). Sleeping: The chance of a dragon being
    asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping
    dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may
    sometimes pretend to be asleep! Subduing: Will surrender if reduced to 0hp
    by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage
    does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will
    attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself
    or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to
    1,000sp per hp. Age: The following stats describe dragons of average size.
    Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much
    treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.
    Lairs: A dragon's treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is
    seldom unguarded.
