  biography: >-
    One of the hideous fungal life forms that sometimes emerge from the
    Ashblight, an ashcrawler resembles a centipede that stands half as tall as a
    man and is at least ten feet long. The "chitin" of the crawler is nothing
    but a hardened fungal shell around the soft, damp interior of the organism.
    Those bitten by an ashcrawler must make a Physical save or be infected by
    the fungus. Without magical healing, they'll become wholly enslaved by the
    parasitical fungus within a week, becoming a "crawler slave" and using their
    own intellect and abilities to gather new prey for the creature. The stat
    line given for them below reflects an average unlucky peasant, but stronger
    slaves are possible. Crawler slaves can hide most of the infection under
    concealing clothing, and can only be saved by powerful healing magic at the
    GM's discretion.

      description: >-
        Linothorax armor is a stiffer armor of glued, layered cloth, often as
        elaborately decorated as the arts of its maker allow. Light armor may be
        decidedly heavy, but it is loose and flexible enough to offer minimal
        hindrance to the wearer's actions. Some varieties are also discreet
        enough to be worn politely in common society.

        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.
