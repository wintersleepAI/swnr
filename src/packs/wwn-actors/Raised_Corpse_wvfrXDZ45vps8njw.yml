  biography: >-
    Created by the @UUID[Compendium.wwn.arts.Item.M746O61w32xuSNfc]{Raise
    Corpse} spell. Such corpses may be equipped with weapons or armor. Its decay
    or dissolution immediately ceases, and it becomes suicidally loyal to its
    creator. The corpse has no natural volition, but will obey commands with a
    human degree of intelligence. It has only vague memories of its prior life,
    and while it may retain human tics or habits it had in life it can answer
    only the simplest and most self-evident questions. Damage to a corpse can be
    repaired only by casting this spell on it again, which restores it to its
    original "health". The corpse continues to exist until it is reduced to zero
    hit points or its creator releases it. A necromancer cannot have more active
    subjects of this spell than their character level.
