        Swords are common sidearms throughout the Latter Earth. The expense of
        forging a large blade makes it a symbol of wealth and status in many
        cultures, and its convenience makes it a favored arm for street wear.

        Plate armor is an extremely expensive suit of tailored metal pieces that
        cover both the vitals and the limbs of the wearer. Heavy armor is the
        thickest, toughest panoply available on the market, and its bulk and
        noise make its encumbrance apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert checks
        made by the wearer.

        Spears, and their longer cousin the pike, are common military weapons
        throughout the Latter Earth. Lighter spears are effective thrown
        weapons, while heavier two-handed versions penetrate armor well.
