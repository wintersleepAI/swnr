  description: >-
    While anyone can drive a drone under casual circumstances, your knack for it
    is something unusual.<br><br>Level 1: Gain Drive and Fix as bonus skills.
    You acquire or start play with a Remote Control Unit cybersystem and its
    installation. Through connections, scavenging, and parts repurpose, you have
    free drones and their weapons and fittings worth no more than the budget
    given in section 1.6.2. You can repair these drones without needing spare
    parts, and destroyed drones can be replaced with a week's work. You always
    have the equivalent of a drone repair kit on you at no Encumbrance
    cost.<br>Level 2: You can use the Assume Command drone action once per round
    as an On Turn action. Once per scene, gain a bonus Main Action to command a
    drone. Any drones you control gain a +2 bonus to their hit rolls, whether or
    not you're personally firing their weaponry.
