    Level 1:  and you're particularly gifted at preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades."
    Level 2: Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When rolling Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
