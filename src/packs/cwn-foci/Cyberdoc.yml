  description: 'Any skilled medic can implant and maintain cyber systems, but you have a special aptitude for the work.<br><br>Level 1: Gain Fix and Heal as bonus skills. You start play with a cyberdoc kit, and you can implant cyberware even if your Heal skill is level-0. You gain a +2 bonus on all cyber implant surgery skill checks. If you perform cyber maintenance for a person, the delicacy of your adjustments decreases the total System Strain cost of their implants by one point until their next maintenance interval.<br>Level 2: The quality of your cyber maintenance improves; the System Strain decrease is equal to two points now instead of one. You never fail to install cyberware correctly. Once per patient, you can build and install a cyber modification to a system as described in section 2.8.2 without any cost in money or experimental components, assuming you have the requisite skill levels to build it.'
