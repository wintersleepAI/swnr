  description: |-
    You are a frenzy of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can hack down numerous lesser foes in close combatâ€¦ assuming you survive being surrounded.
    Level 1: Gain Stab or Punch as a bonus skill. Once per scene, as an On Turn action, apply your Shock damage to all foes within melee range, assuming they're susceptible to your Shock. 
    Level 2: The first time you kill someone in a round with a normal attack, either with its rolled damage on a hit or with the Shock damage it inflicts, instantly gain a second attack on any target within range using any Ready weapon you have.
