     "A skilled hacker can program their own utilities
    Level 1:  but you take this expertise far beyond the norm."
    Level 2: Gain Program as a bonus skill. You can create and maintain an additional number of program elements equal to your character level+2, split among Verbs and Subjects as you see fit as explained in section 4.3.0. You can change your choices with a week's work. Once per day, as an On Turn action, you can make an on-the-fly edit to a Subject program element to turn it into any other Subject program element you need. The element remains altered until you change it again.
