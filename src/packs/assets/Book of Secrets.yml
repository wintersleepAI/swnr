  description: Exhaustively cataloged psychometric records on important and influential local figures, allowing uncanny accuracy in predicting their actions. Once per turn, a Book of Secrets allows the faction to reroll one die for an action taken on that world or force an enemy faction to reroll one die. This reroll can only be forced once per turn, no matter how many Books of Secrets are owned.
