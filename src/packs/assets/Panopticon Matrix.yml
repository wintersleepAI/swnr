  description: These facilities weave braked-AI intelligence analysts into a web of observation capable of detecting the slightest evidence of intruders on a world. Every rival Stealthed asset on the planet must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning test at the beginning of every turn or lose their Stealth. The owner also gains an additional die on all Cunning attacks and defenses on that planet.
