  description: Usable to block the governmental permission that is sometimes required to buy an asset or transport it into a system. When a rival faction gains permission to do so, the Lobbyists can make an immediate Cunning vs. Cunning test against the faction; if successful, the permission is withdrawn and cannot be re-attempted until next turn.
