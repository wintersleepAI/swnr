  description: Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make cleaning them out a costly and dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the same planet as the Boltholes suffers damage sufficient to destroy it, it is instead set at 0 HP and rendered untouchable and unusable until it is repaired to full strength. If the Boltholes are destroyed before this happens, the asset is destroyed with them.
