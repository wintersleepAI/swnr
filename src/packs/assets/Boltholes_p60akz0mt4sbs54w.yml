  description: >-
    Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make cleaning them out a
    costly and dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special Forces or Military Unit
    asset on the same planet as the Boltholes suffers damage sufficient to
    destroy it, it is instead set at 0 HP and rendered untouchable and unusable
    until it is repaired to full strength. If the Boltholes are destroyed before
    this happens, the asset is destroyed with them.
