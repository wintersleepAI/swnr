  description: These advanced transport ships are capable of moving an asset long distances. As an action, any one non-Starship asset, including itself, can be moved between any two worlds within three hexes of the deep strike landers, at a cost of 2 FacCreds. This movement can be done even if the local planetary government objects, albeit doing so is usually an act of open war.
