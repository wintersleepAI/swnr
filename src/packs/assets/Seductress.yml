  description: They and their male equivalents subvert the leadership of enemy assets. As an action, a Seductress can travel to any world within one hex. As an attack, a Seductress does no damage, but an asset that has been successfully attacked immediately reveals any other Stealthed assets of that faction on the planet. Only Special Forces units can attack a Seductress.
