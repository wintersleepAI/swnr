  description: Minions that lace a planet's underworld, watchful for intruders. They can choose to Attack a faction without specifying a target asset. On a successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack, all Stealthed assets on the planet belonging to that faction are revealed. Informers can target a faction even if none of their assets are visible on a world; at worst, they simply learn that there are no stealthed assets.
