  description: The pride of an empire, this is a collection of massive capital warships without peer in most sectors. Capital fleets are expensive to keep flying, and cost an additional 2 FacCreds of maintenance each turn. As an action, they may move to any world within three hexes of their current location. Planetary government permission is required to raise a capital fleet, but not to move one into a system.
