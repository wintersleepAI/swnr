  description: This asset reflects a deniable connection with a local licensee for the faction's goods and services. When a Franchise successfully attacks a enemy asset, the enemy faction loses one FacCred (if available), which is gained by the Franchise's owner. This loss can happen only once a turn, no matter how many Franchises attack.
