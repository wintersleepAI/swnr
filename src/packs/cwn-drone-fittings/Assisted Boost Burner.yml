  description: The drone is equipped with reactive chemical booster that can be ignited to give it a very brief burst of tremendous speed. When activated as a Move action, the burner launches the drone up to 500 meters in a straight line. The boost is not precise enough to use as an aimed weapon, but solid obstacles in front of the drone will suffer half the drone`s HP in damage and inflict all of theirs on the drone. The burner functions only once before it require a scene to regenerate its charge.
