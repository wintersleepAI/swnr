  description: The drone is equipped to monitor its surroundings autonomously and alert its pilot when something of interest is noticed. Its onboard intelligence is limited, however, and it can only handle about a sentence`s worth of specific orders or subjects to be watchful for. Putting a drone in Watch mode is a command that takes a Main Action.
