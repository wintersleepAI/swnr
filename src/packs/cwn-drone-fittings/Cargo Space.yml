  description: Most drones are designed to carry only their own weight. This fitting upgrades engines and adds cargo mounts to the drone`s exterior; it can carry up to 3 points of Encumbrance now, but the drone`s own Encumbrance value is increased by one. Any additional cargo it carries is added to this burden, of course. Carried cargo is sealed within the drone and requires a Main Action to dig out.
