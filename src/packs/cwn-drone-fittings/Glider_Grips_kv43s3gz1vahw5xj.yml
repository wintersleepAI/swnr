  description: >-
    Usable only by flying drones of Enc 3 size or greater, this fitting allows a
    human-sized mass to use the drone as a form of parachute-glider. As a Main
    Action, a user can leap off a high place after grabbing the drone and
    descend safely to the ground at a distance as far from the initial point as
    that point was above the ground. Similar weights can be sent safely to the
    ground in the same way.
