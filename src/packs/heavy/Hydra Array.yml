  description: Hydra arrays sequence a number of missile launchers to fire at once. The gunner designates up to three targets and can then make three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the best result. A volley from the array costs 150 credits.
