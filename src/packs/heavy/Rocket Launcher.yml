  description: Rocket launchers cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are usually equipped with basic tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket launchers take a 04 hit penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most Heavy weapons, rocket launchers can be shoulder-fired without a prepared emplacement to support them.
