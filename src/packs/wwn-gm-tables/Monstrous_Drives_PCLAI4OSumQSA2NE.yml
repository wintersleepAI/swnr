description: >-
  What makes a creature monstrous is not necessarily what it is, but what it
  does. Something about the creatureâ€™s behavior or wants is anathema to human
  interests, and its activities bring misery, suffering, and death to the people
  around it.

      <b>Conquest: </b>it needs to destroy all rivals and interlopers within its
      territory, which must expand with the creature's increasing might. This
      may be a very literal form of conquest, with the beast seeking to kill any
      intruder within its realm and probing outward constantly to seek new land.
      It may also be social or metaphorical, with the creature seeking to become
      the exclusive power within a social sphere, profession, guild, or skein of
      relationships.

      <b>Construction:</b> it has to build something that can cause problems for
      humans. It might be driven to create elaborate nests, forced to foment
      treacherous schemes against humanity, made to build large civil structures
      in awkward places, manufacture a particular sort of good beyond all need,
      generate a toxin or miasma, xenoform terrain to fit its alien creator's
      home world, or some other act of troublesome creation.

      <b>Consumption:</b> it needs to eat something that is either difficult to
      acquire, greatly troublesome to humanity, or magical or metaphorical in
      nature. It might consume loving relationships, eat youth, dine exclusively
      on traitors, be impossibly gluttonous, devour magical items, or need
      special alchemical mixes.

      <b>Deception:</b> it must feign some harmless or innocent guise, fitting
      in perfectly as its adopted role. Animals may seem to be some different,
      more docile creature, while intelligent beings may masquerade as humans or
      adopt some specific social role. It must kill whatever it would replace,
      and destroy anything or anyone that might threaten to reveal the truth
      about it, showing the reality of its nature only when it feeds or enjoys
      the benefits of the role it has adopted.

      <b>Defilement:</b> it must degrade and destroy those things that give hope
      or meaning to humanity. Corrupting religions, poisoning food crops,
      curdling familial love, inducing leaders to become tyrants, and withering
      bonds of loyalty might all be tools for such creatures. Most of them will
      have a particular type of good thing that their powers and nature enable
      them to debauch.

      <b>Destruction:</b> it must destroy something that is useful or necessary
      to humans. It might blindly slaughter livestock beyond all hunting need,
      instinctively seek the destruction of man-made edifices, have an inherent
      compulsion to destroy loving relationships, eat metal tools and weapons,
      consume the health and luck of its prey, or otherwise take away something
      that humans need.

      <b>Domination:</b> it needs to win the slavish submission of its chosen
      prey. Rather than killing them, they must be reduced to helpless obedience
      to the creature's needs and wishes. Animals may terrorize sentients until
      worship or tribute is offered, while intelligent beings might use social
      tools or threats to force compliance. Weaker creatures of its own kind
      might be treated with similar brutality.

      <b>Parasitization:</b> it has to subvert and suborn humanity or something
      humans rely upon. This may be a physical act of parasitization on a human
      host, or it may be a more metaphorical leech, taking advantage of some
      quality of human society to feed and shelter it. Parasitized hosts may be
      hollowed-out skinsuits, helplessly enslaved victims, willing but foolish
      co-conspirators, unwitting cattle, or humans who can provide some special
      service or quality the creature craves.

      <b>Predation: </b>there's something that it absolutely must hunt or kill,
      and pursuing them is a need at an instinctive level. This is usually
      something problematic for humans, such as a compulsion to hunt humans,
      specific types of people, livestock, particular demihumans, people who
      have committed a particular type of act, those who trespass on its
      territory, or some other type of victim.

      <b>Reproduction: </b>it has some unique or difficult condition for
      reproduction that it must satisfy, such as needing large amounts of a
      particular substance, a properly-built nest, a difficult-to-win mate, a
      helpless parasitized host, the brutal conquest of its rivals, or even some
      magical or esoterically metaphorical condition. This condition causes
      problems for humanity around it.

      <b>Sadism:</b> it was created not necessarily to kill its prey, but to
      torment it. Terrifying taunts, senseless cruelty, and abominably awful
      methods of harm are employed instinctively by this creature, and it will
      always prefer to leave its prey alive until every ounce of resistance has
      been wrung from it. It receives great delight from the suffering of
      others.

      <b>Theft:</b> it has a compulsion to steal something that humans need in
      order to hoard or use it itself. It may compulsively steal and collect
      gold and other shiny objects, plunder food, carry off large amounts of
      some socially-necessary good, or have magical means to take away
      intangible qualities or social relationships. It should often be possible
      to recover the lost traits if the creature is subdued.
