  description: >-
    Ingesting one of these small pills rapidly flattens a user's capacity for
    emotional distress while heavily increasing their aggressiveness. For
    roughly one hour, users gain a +2 bonus to Morale checks and experience no
    immediate emotional trauma from performing even the most heinous and violent
    actions. The drug is a favorite pre-fight dose among gangers, and used as
    self-medication among many of them who would otherwise be incapacitated by
    the emotional scars of what they've done.
