  description: The ship can disguise its long-range sensor readings, spoofing scans with the ID tags and apparent hull type of any other ship of its choice. To penetrate this masquerade, the scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program skill check against difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking ship's comms officer. Once the ship is close enough to visually identify, the masking is useless.
