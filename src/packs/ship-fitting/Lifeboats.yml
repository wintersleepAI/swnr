  description: Selecting this fitting equips the ship with a number of single-use escape craft capable of reaching the nearest habitable planet or station in a star system. If no such destination exists, the boats can maintain their passengers for a year in drugged semi-stasis. Lifeboats have fully-functional comms systems and are usually equipped with basic survival supplies and distress beacons. A single selection of this fitting provides enough lifeboats for a ship's maximum crew, with up to twenty people per boat.
