  description: On-board workshops can be bought at smaller than maximum sizes than a hull would allow, if additional TL4 tech facilities aren't strictly needed. A frigate-sized workshop is sufficient for modding any personal gear as per the modification rules on page 90. A cruiser-sized workshop handles vehicle modding and starship maintenance, and a capital-class workshop can build vehicles or similar large work from scratch at full cost.
