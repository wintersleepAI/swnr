  description: A ship can improve its standard-issue drive-1 spike drive with additional phase filters and power throughput refinements. A captain needs to buy only the final grade of drive desired. He does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts that cannot be built on most modern worlds.
