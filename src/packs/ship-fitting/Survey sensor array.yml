  description: Most ships require only basic analysis of a star system, sufficient to identify population centers, do rough scanning of an object's composition, and char major navigational hazards. Survey sensor arrays greatly enhance the ship's sensor abilities, allowing for finely-detailed mapping of objects and planets, along with broad spectrum communications analysis. They also improve attempts to detect other craft when scanning a region for stealthy vessels. Any rolls with survey sensor arrays add +2 to skill checks.
