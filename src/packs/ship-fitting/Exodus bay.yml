  description: These banked rows of compressed cold sleep pods are designed to carry enormous numbers of people in extended hibernation, most often colonists to some new homeworld or escapees from some stellar disaster. A cruiser can carry up to 1000 colonists in stasis, while a capital ship can handle up to 5000. Each further time this fitting is selected, these numbers double. These pods put Their inhabitants into very deep hibernation so as to minimize the resources necessary to maintain their lives. Bringing them out of stasis requires a month of 'defrost'. Crash awakenings have a 25% chance of killing the subject. The pods are rated for 100 years of stasis, but their actual maximum duration is somewhat speculative.
