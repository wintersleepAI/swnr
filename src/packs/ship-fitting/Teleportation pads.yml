  description: This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was uncommon even on Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen people or 1200 kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from the surface of a planet or the interior of another ship, provided it is no more than a few tens of thousands of kilometers distant. Ship-to-ship teleportation is possible only when the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting accurate coordinate details; otherwise, a friendly unjammed signal from inside is necessary to lock onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are possible only in the absence of physical barriers between the ship and the target point below. The teleporters may be used once every five minutes. In those rare sectors where this tech is widely available, it costs 200k.
