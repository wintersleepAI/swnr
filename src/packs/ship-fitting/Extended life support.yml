  description: The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew or passengers. Extended life support can be fitted multiple times; each time, the maximum crew rating of the ship increases by 100% of its normal maximum. Thus, a free merchant who installs this twice can have a maximum complement of 18 people.
