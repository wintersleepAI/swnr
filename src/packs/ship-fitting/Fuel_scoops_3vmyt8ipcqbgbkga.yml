  description: >-
    Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction of hydrogen from gas
    giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process requires four
    days of processing and refinement, but completely refuels the ship. Such
    fittings are common on explorer craft that cannot expect to find refueling
    stations.
