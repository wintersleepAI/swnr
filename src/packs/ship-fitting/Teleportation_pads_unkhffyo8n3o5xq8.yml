  description: >-
    This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was uncommon
    even on Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen people or 1200
    kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from the surface of a planet or
    the interior of another ship, provided it is no more than a few tens of
    thousands of kilometers distant. Ship-to-ship teleportation is possible only
    when the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting accurate coordinate
    details; otherwise, a friendly unjammed signal from inside is necessary to
    lock onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are possible only in
    the absence of physical barriers between the ship and the target point
    below. The teleporters may be used once every five minutes. In those rare
    sectors where this tech is widely available, it costs 200k.
