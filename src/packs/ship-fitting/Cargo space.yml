  description: Free mas can be traded for pressurized cargo space. Tracked by weight for convenience, one cubic meter is usually one ton, with most vehicles requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks taking 25, and aircraft or mechs taking up 50 tons of cargo space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons of cargo space in a fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200 tons in a cruiser and 2000 tons in a capital-class ship. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
