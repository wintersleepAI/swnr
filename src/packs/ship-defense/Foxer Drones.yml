  description: These drones are invariably short-lived due to enormous energy signatures they produce, but until the ship's next turn they grant a +2 AC bonus as their emissions confuse foes. Foxer drones are cheaply constructed and essentially free; the only limit on their number is the amount of free space set aside for holding them.
