  description: >-
    The drone has autonomous attack routines wired into it. As a Main Action, it
    can be ordered to kill one specific visible target. If the target is in
    range of its weapons, it will use its Main Action to attack; if no
    additional fittings are added, its autonomous attacks have a total hit bonus
    of +2. The drone will not automatically move to follow or engage its target
    or otherwise position itself tactically unless directly piloted to do so or
    operating under the Follow command.
