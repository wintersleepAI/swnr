  description: >-
    Most flying drones have an effective ceiling of 1,000 meters if there are no
    scramblers to lessen the effective control range. This unit increases a
    flying drone`s maximum altitude to 5,000 meters, making most effectively
    invisible to ordinary sight. Such height does, however, make it extremely
    conspicuous to aerial scanners used by city law enforcement and
    high-security corp buildings. The speed of their response will depend on the
    drone`s apparent threat.
