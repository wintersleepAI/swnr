  description: >-
    You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others
    instinctively follow your instructions and further your causes. Where this
    Focus refers to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be
    in your service. PCs never count as followers.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Lead
    as a bonus skill. Once per day, you can make a request from an NPC who is
    not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at a difficulty of
    the NPC's Morale score. If you succeed, they will comply with the request,
    provided it is not harmful or very uncharacteristic.<br />Level 2: Those who
    follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC being directly led by you
    gains a Morale and hit roll bonus equal to your Lead skill and a +1 bonus on
    all skill checks. Your followers will not act against your interests unless
    under extreme pressure.
