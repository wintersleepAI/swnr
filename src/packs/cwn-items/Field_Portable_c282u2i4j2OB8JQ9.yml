    Only Small or Medium vehicles can take this option, allowing them to be
    broken down into easily-portable parts packages. Small vehicles turn into 30
    items of Encumbrance and Medium ones into 150. Disassembly takes 30 minutes
    for a Small vehicle and 3 hours for a Medium one, with reassembly taking
    four times as long.
