  description: >-
    An array of injectors, scalpels, sutures, and trauma chems are built into
    the drone, allowing it to function as a medkit and make Heal skill checks
    for a medically-competent pilot or an on-site doc in need of a kit. Such
    medical efforts require a Main Action from the pilot as usual, and flying
    drones apply a -2 penalty to the skill check due to their innate
    instability. Up to six pharmaceutical doses of the pilot`s choice can be
    loaded into the drone.
