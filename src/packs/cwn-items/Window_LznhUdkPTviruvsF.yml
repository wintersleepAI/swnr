  description: >-
    (Heal-1) A neurobooster favored among hackers and knowledge workers, Window
    augments the user's focus and mental reaction speed at the cost of
    distracting them from their terrestrial surroundings. A Window user can
    trade their Move action to gain a bonus Main Action that can only be used
    for cyberspace actions. Each time this is done in a scene, however, the user
    gains one System Strain. One dose lasts for one scene.
