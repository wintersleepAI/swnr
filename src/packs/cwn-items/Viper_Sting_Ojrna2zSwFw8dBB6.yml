  description: >-
    A tool of assassins, a Viper Sting is a fang, fingernail needle, palm
    injector, or more exotic implement for injecting an unsuspecting target with
    a drug of the user's choice. A Viper Sting can be loaded with up to four
    doses of pharmaceuticals, dispensed as the user wishes. If loaded with a
    toxin, it does 1d12 damage with a 1d10/x3 Trauma Die. If a tranquilizer is
    used, the damage is the same, but unconsciousness will result instead of
    death. A Viper Sting can only be effectively used as part of an Execution
    Attack, as an alert opponent can avoid it easily. This cyber inflicts a -2
    penalty on any check to detect its presence.
