  description: >-
    (Heal-0) A somewhat pricey combat drug favored by shock troops and those
    first out of the trenches, Avalanche numbs sensations of pain or exhaustion
    for one hour, granting the user an effective +10 to their current hit
    points, even if it takes them above their maximum. This numbness tends to
    make it harder to notice serious harms, however, and the d12 roll for any
    Major Injury suffered while under its effects takes a -1 penalty.
