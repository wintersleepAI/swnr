  description: >-
    A watery black toxin that must be administered through food or direct
    injection, Hellbender causes the victim to convulse with bone-cracking force
    shortly after consumption. A dose of Hellbender has a distinct acrid taste,
    but if the victim consumes it they must make a Physical saving throw or
    begin convulsing helplessly for 1d6 rounds, suffering 1d10 damage each round
    unless restrained by at least two associates. This damage can kill an
    unfortunate victim.
