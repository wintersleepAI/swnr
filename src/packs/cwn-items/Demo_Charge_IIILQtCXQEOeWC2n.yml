  description: >-
    Demo charges are shaped explosive charges usually meant to knock human-sized
    holes in anything short of fortified defensive walls. While ineffective as
    thrown weapons, when used as part of a trap or ambush they inflict their
    listed damage in a cone out to normal range, with an Evasion save for half
    damage. If applied carefully to a vehicle target, the following explosion
    will inevitably destroy it. Like frag grenades, use of demo charges tends to
    be very exciting to security forces and can provoke more heat than many
    operators like to draw. This weapon's Trauma Die can inflict Traumatic Hits
    on drones, vehicles, and other machines.
