  description: >-
    You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can manipulate
    the attitudes of those around you. Even so, while smooth words are
    versatile, they'll only work if your interlocutor is actually willing to
    listen to you.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Talk as a bonus skill. You speak all
    the languages common to the city and can learn new ones to a workable level
    in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check dice
    related to negotiation or diplomacy.<br />Level 2: Once per game session,
    shift an intelligent NPC's reaction roll one step closer to friendly if you
    can talk to them for at least thirty seconds.
