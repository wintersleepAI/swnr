  description: >-
    Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weapons are available almost
    anywhere on the street. Particularly impoverished gangers sometimes fashion
    makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better canâ€™t be obtained. Such
    weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls
    due to their ungainly make. This is a two-handed weapon, making it
    impossible to have a Readied item in the user's off-hand
