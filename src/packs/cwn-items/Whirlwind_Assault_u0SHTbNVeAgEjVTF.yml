  description: >-
    You are a frenzy of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can hack down numerous
    lesser foes in close combat… assuming you survive being surrounded.<br /><br
    />Level 1: Gain Stab or Punch as a bonus skill. Once per scene, as an On
    Turn action, apply your Shock damage to all foes within melee range,
    assuming they're susceptible to your Shock. <br />Level 2: The first time
    you kill someone in a round with a normal attack, either with its rolled
    damage on a hit or with the Shock damage it inflicts, instantly gain a
    second attack on any target within range using any Ready weapon you have.
