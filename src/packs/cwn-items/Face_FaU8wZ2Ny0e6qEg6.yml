  description: >-
    Gain Connect as a bonus skill. Once per game week, whenever it's convenient,
    gain one temporary Acquaintance Contact of your choice, describing them in
    any way the GM finds acceptable. You lose touch with this Contact after you
    use this Edge again, but you can use this Edge to connect with them again at
    a different time. You may also provide favors or payment sufficient to
    cement the relationship at the GM's discretion.
