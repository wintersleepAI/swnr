    You have a natural talent for modifying and improving equipment, as given in
    the rules in section 2.8.2.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill.
    Your Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many
    mods. Vehicle, cyber, and gear mods cost only half their usual price in
    dollars, though experimental component requirements remain the same.<br
    />Level 2: Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for purposes of
    building and maintaining mods and calculating your Maintenance score, up to
    a maximum of Fix-5. Advanced mods require one fewer experimental components
    to make, down to a minimum of zero.
