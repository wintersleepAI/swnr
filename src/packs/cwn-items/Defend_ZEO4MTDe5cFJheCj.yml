  description: >-
    A special Verb that can only be targeted at a friendly device or allied
    cyberware user within range, and costs no Access to use. While the program
    remains running, any hostile hacking attempts aimed at that device or any of
    the target's cyber systems must first beat the user in an opposed
    Int/Program skill check before they can attempt their hack. This Verb cannot
    negate programs that are already running on the target.
