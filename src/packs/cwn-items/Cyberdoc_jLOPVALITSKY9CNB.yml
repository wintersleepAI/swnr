  description: >-
    Any skilled medic can implant and maintain cyber systems, but you have a
    special aptitude for the work.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Fix and Heal as
    bonus skills. You start play with a cyberdoc kit, and you can implant
    cyberware even if your Heal skill is level-0. You gain a +2 bonus on all
    cyber implant surgery skill checks. If you perform cyber maintenance for a
    person, the delicacy of your adjustments decreases the total System Strain
    cost of their implants by one point until their next maintenance
    interval.<br />Level 2: The quality of your cyber maintenance improves; the
    System Strain decrease is equal to two points now instead of one. You never
    fail to install cyberware correctly. Once per patient, you can build and
    install a cyber modification to a system as described in section 2.8.2
    without any cost in money or experimental components, assuming you have the
    requisite skill levels to build it.
