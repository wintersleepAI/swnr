  description: >-
    (Heal-1) Not so much a single drug as a pharmaceutical suite in a single
    injection system, this chem requires a skilled physician to adjust its mix.
    When used as part of a first aid attempt, this drug doubles the amount of
    hit points recovered by the attempt, with a minimum healing rate of 6 HP.
    Rumors of a drastically increased rate of bone cancers among regular users
    are, of course, mere slander against its manufacturer.
