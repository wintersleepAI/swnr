  description: >-
    You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain advantages in carrying
    out an Execution Attack as described in the rules in section 2.4.7.3.<br
    /><br />Level 1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an object no
    larger than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip
    search, including normal weapon detection devices. You can draw or produce
    this object as an On Turn action, and your point-blank ranged attacks made
    from surprise with it cannot miss the target.<br />Level 2: You can take a
    Move action on the same round as you make an Execution Attack, closing
    rapidly with a target before you attack. You may split this Move action when
    making an Execution Attack, taking part of it before you murder your target
    and part of it afterwards. This movement happens too quickly to alert a
    victim or to be hindered by bodyguards not directly in your path.
