  description: >-
    One of a thousand different medical drugs, a prescription like this is often
    necessary to treat some chronic condition or keep a medical problem from
    growing worse. Corp employees get their drugs for a pittance, but less
    fortunate souls need to source their drugs from extortionate corp pharmacies
    or street docs. Lucky users only need a dose a few times a week, but others
    must have a daily supply or suffer potentially lethal complications.
