  description: >-
    Headshot pods are a family of guided missiles meant for mounted deployment
    on vehicles or large drones. They always target AC 10 to hit, but require
    two full consecutive rounds of aiming at a visible target to get a target
    lock on them and prime for firing on the third round. Any bystanders within
    5 meters of the impact take damage as if from a frag grenade. A headshot pod
    missile costs $2,000.
