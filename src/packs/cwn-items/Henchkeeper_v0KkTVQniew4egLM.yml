  description: >-
    You have a distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do your
    bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement,
    sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A
    henchman obtained with this Focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly
    betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important”
    people, and are usually marginal sorts, criminals, the desperate, or other
    persons with few options.You can use more conventional pay or inducements to
    acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings are no more loyal or
    competent than your pay and treatment can purchase.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain
    Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within 24 hours of arriving
    in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen
    will not fight except to save their own lives, but will go with you on
    missions and risk great danger to help you. Most corper henchmen will have 5
    HP, a +0 attack bonus, and a Morale of 7, plus whatever gear they're given.
    Slum-dwellers and other natives of harsh societies will fight as Street
    Thugs per page 188 if pressed. You can have one henchmen at a time for every
    three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release henchmen with
    no hard feelings at any plausible time and pick them back up later should
    you be without a current henchman.<br />Level 2: Your henchmen are
    remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you against anything but
    clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural competence or their
    devotion to you, they're treated as a Basic Corp Security from page 186. You
    can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs, but this
    requires that you actually have done them some favor or help that would
    reasonably earn such fierce loyalty.
