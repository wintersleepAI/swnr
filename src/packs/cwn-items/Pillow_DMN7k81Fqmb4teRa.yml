  description: >-
    (Heal-0) A powerful sedative that requires medical expertise to administer
    properly, Pillow must be injected into a restrained or helpless subject, as
    vigorous physical action can disrupt the effects. Once injected, the subject
    falls into a torpor indistinguishable from death that lasts for 24 hours.
    They require only trace amounts of oxygen while in their trance, and can be
    identified as alive only through careful medical examination. If Pillow is
    administered with less than a 24-hour gap between doses, the victim must
    make a Physical save or die sometime before the dose ends.
