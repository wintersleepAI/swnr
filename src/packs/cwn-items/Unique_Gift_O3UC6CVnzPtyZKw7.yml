  description: >-
    Your PC has a unique piece of cyberware, an exceptional human ability, or
    some experimental genetic modification that grants them some benefit that
    isn't covered under existing options.This benefit shouldn't be a simple
    bonus to something you already do; it should be a power or ability that
    gives you options that you just wouldn't have otherwise. It also shouldn't
    be used to simply optimize an existing character concept, but instead should
    allow you to make a character who wouldn't make sense without this special
    ability. It's up to the GM to decide what's reasonable and fair to be
    covered under this gift, and whatever they allow should be roughly
    equivalent to the existing Focus options in overall power If an ability is
    particularly powerful or the cybernetics are especially draining, it might
    require the user to take System Strain to use it, as described on page 40.
    As a general rule this ability should be better than a piece of gear the PC
    could buy. The player is spending a very limited resource when they make
    this Focus pick, so what they get should be good enough that they can't just
    duplicate it with a fat bank account.<br /><br />Level 1: <br />Level 2:
