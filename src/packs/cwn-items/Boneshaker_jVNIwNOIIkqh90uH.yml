  description: >-
    A filthy mix of jailbroken corp industrial chems and amphetamine scrapings,
    Boneshaker is a popular combat drug among the most impoverished or savage
    street gangs. On application, the subject is filled with blind aggression,
    gaining a +2 Morale bonus and a +2 bonus to hit rolls, damage, and Shock.
    The recklessness induced by Boneshaker leaves them wide open, however, and
    all attacks against them add +2 to any Trauma Die rolls. Boneshaker lasts
    for one scene and adds 2 System Strain at the end of it.
