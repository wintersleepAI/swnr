  description: >-
    The drone is equipped with minimal autonomous pursuit capabilities. As a
    Main Action, the drone can be ordered to follow a particular visible target
    at a given distance at either half or full speed. If half speed, it will use
    its Move action to follow, and full speed will use both Move and Main
    Actions. Following can be ended as an On Turn command.
