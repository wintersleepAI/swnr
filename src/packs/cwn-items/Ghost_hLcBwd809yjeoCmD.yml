  description: >-
    You are uncannily elusive. Gain Sneak as a bonus skill and the Fighting
    Withdrawal combat action is an On Turn action for you. Once per scene,
    reroll a failed Sneak check related to sneaking or going unseen. Once per
    game day, as a Move action, move up to 10 meters without anyone around you
    seeing you move. If you use this movement to get behind cover, you might
    seem to vanish outright to onlookers.
