  description: >-
    Advanced weapons employ modern polymers, sophisticated metallurgy, fractal
    edges, electro-stun tech, and a small legion of marketers to sell products
    that are distinctly superior to the plain steel edges of a prior age. An
    advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go through bone like bamboo and keep
    an edge for weeks between sharpenings. The more martial offerings go to even
    greater lengths in their marketing, with some enterprising serial killers
    and gang enforcers inking exclusivity deals with particular knife
    manufacturers. This is a two-handed weapon, making it impossible to have a
    Readied item in the user's off-hand
