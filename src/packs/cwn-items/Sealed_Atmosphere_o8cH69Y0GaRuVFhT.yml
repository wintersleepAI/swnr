  description: >-
    For up to two hours per day the vehicle can seal itself entirely from the
    outside atmosphere, with internal air tanks and positive pressure to keep
    out external toxins. At all times it can maintain a comfortable interior
    temperature in any terrestrial climate. Aircraft do not need this fitting to
    function normally at high altitudes.
