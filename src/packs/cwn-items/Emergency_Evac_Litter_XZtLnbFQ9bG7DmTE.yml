  description: >-
    Functioning only for ground based drones of Enc 3 or greater, the drone is
    equipped with a retractable litter that can fit one human patient, along
    with manipulators sufficient to get a prone victim onto the litter with a
    Main Action. Onboard meds allow for remote Heal skill checks to stabilize a
    Mortally Wounded target, with one attempt allowed as part of the loading
    action. A loaded patient can`t be harmed until the drone is destroyed or
    opens the litter, but if the drone dies, the patient does too. As a Main
    Action, the drone can be ordered to autonomously take the patient to a
    particular location. As an On Turn action, an onboard transmitter can also
    place a call for medical assistance to a pre-arranged number.
