  description: As an On Turn action, the user can nominate a target within 20 meters. Until they get more than 100 meters away from the user or pass behind a solid barrier, the implant's hyper-specific hearing can track their motions perfectly and overhear anything they say or that is said to them. The user can listen to one such target at a time.
