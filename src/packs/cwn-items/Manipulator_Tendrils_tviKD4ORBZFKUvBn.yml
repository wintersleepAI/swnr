  description: >-
    One set of manipulators is added to the drone, whether a mechanical claw, an
    articulated metal tendril, or some other device. With a Main Action command
    from the pilot, it can function as a single human hand with an effective
    Strength of 12, but it cannot effectively be used for an attack or to lift
    anything heavier than the drone itself. The fitting can carry things for
    short distances, but to haul weight any real distance the Cargo Space
    fitting is required. This fitting can be added more than once if a pair of
    `hands` are needed.
