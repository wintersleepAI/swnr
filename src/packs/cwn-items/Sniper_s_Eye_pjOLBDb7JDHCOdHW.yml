  description: >-
    You are an expert at placing a bullet or arrow on an unsuspecting target.
    These special benefits only apply when making an Execution Attack with a
    gun, bow, or thrown weapon, as described in section 2.4.7.3.<br /><br
    />Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making a skill check for a
    ranged Execution Attack or target shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest
    die.<br />Level 2: You don't miss ranged Execution Attacks. A target hit by
    one takes a -4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate
    mortal injury. Even if the save is successful, the target takes double the
    normal damage inflicted by the attack.
