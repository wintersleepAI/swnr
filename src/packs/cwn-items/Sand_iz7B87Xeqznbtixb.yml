  description: >-
    A gritty powder trafficked to those addicts too poor to afford anything
    better, a snorted dose of Sand will put its user into a euphoric haze for as
    long as an hour, depending on tolerance. Beautiful visions and dreamy
    contentment give way to shooting pains and intense light sensitivity
    afterwards, with most heavy users dying within six to twelve months of
    picking up the habit.
