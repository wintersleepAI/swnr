  description: >-
    While anyone can drive a drone under casual circumstances, your knack for it
    is something unusual.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Drive and Fix as bonus
    skills. You acquire or start play with a Remote Control Unit cybersystem and
    its installation. Through connections, scavenging, and parts repurpose, you
    have free drones and their weapons and fittings worth no more than the
    budget given in section 1.6.2. You can repair these drones without needing
    spare parts, and destroyed drones can be replaced with a week's work. You
    always have the equivalent of a drone repair kit on you at no Encumbrance
    cost.<br />Level 2: You can use the Assume Command drone action once per
    round as an On Turn action. Once per scene, gain a bonus Main Action to
    command a drone. Any drones you control gain a +2 bonus to their hit rolls,
    whether or not you're personally firing their weaponry.
