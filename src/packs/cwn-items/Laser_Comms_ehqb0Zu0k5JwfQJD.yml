  description: >-
    This fitting provides both a set of universal transceiver plug-ins and a
    laser comm hub for the drone. Provided the PCs are in line of sight of the
    drone, normal radio-wave based comms can be switched to lasers, providing
    uncrackable, electromagnetically-inaudible communications within the group.
    Radio comms can still be used as needed.
