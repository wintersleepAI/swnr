  description: >-
    Most drones are designed to carry only their own weight. This fitting
    upgrades engines and adds cargo mounts to the drone`s exterior; it can carry
    up to 3 points of Encumbrance now, but the drone`s own Encumbrance value is
    increased by one. Any additional cargo it carries is added to this burden,
    of course. Carried cargo is sealed within the drone and requires a Main
    Action to dig out.
