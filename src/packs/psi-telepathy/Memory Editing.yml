  description: <p>The telepath can make simple edits to the memory of a target currently linked by a <em>Telepathic Contact</em>. Events of no more than 24 hours in duration can be erased from memory, conversations can be created or changed, new events can be added to a day, or other similar alterations made. The psychic can make these changes as a Main Action by Committing Effort for the day. If the psychic doesn’t have a good understanding of the memories they’re changing, such as might be granted by the level-4 degree of <em>Telepathic Contact</em>, the edits they make may not fit well. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist editing for the rest of the scene, but on a failure, they will not notice the changed memories until given a reason to recollect them.</p>
