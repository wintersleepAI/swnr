  description: <p>Once a telepath has made a <em>Telepathic Contact</em> with a target, they can thereafter activate the technique whenever that target is within 100 kilometers, whether or not the psychic knows where they are. At Telepathy-3 the range increases to 1,000 kilometers, and at Telepathy-4 it extends over an entire planet and up to orbital distances. This distant connection is tenuous, however, and the psychic cannot use any technique through it that would allow the target a saving throw to resist.</p>
