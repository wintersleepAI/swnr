  description: >-
    Lift (Heal-0): A Lift stim augments and amplifies the body’s natural
    response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural
    recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user’s Heal skill in hit points
    after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do not work on PCs who are mortally
    wounded; they need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them, though
    application to a stabilized target will get them back on their feet and
    active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each
    additional application of Lift to a target the same day increases the
    minimum Heal skill needed by 1.
