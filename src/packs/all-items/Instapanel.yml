  description: 'Instapanel: In its compressed form, an instapanel is a two-kilo cube of ceraplast five centimeters on a side. When a type A power cell is inserted in the cubeâ€™s side, it immediately expands to an opaque, waterproof ceraplast sheet 2 meters on each side and a centimeter thick. Five minutes later the ceraplast hardens into a tough, rigid shape, but until then it can be folded or bent by hand. Instapanels can be bonded to one another with a metatool or a toolkit. Breaking an instapanel requires inflicting at least twelve points of damage on it.'
