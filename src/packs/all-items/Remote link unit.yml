  description: 'Remote link unit: These data broadcast link units have been preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and sophisticated data progression algorithms. Two of these links can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote data storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a -2 penalty to any attempts to hack through it. Professional-grade security systems often have means to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit.'
