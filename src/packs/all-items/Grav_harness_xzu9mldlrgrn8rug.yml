  description: >-
    Grav harness: This advanced gravitic harness allows clumsy flight at a rate
    of 20 meters per round as a Main Action. It requires a Type B power cell to
    fuel it, and the miniaturized electronics are rapacious, consuming the cell
    in five minutes of operation. It can lift up to 200 kilos.
