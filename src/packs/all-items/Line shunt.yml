  description: 'Line shunt: These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift color to blend with its surroundings. One or more line shunts must be applied at specific locations within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not need to be directly in contact with a data line but only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are single-use, and keep functioning until removed.'
