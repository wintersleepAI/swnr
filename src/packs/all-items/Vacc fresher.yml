  description: 'Vacc fresher: This three-kilo tube filters and compresses atmosphere to refill vacc suit oxygen tanks. It can extract oxygen from any atmosphere which contains it, even in the form of carbon dioxide. Refilling a standard vacc suit tank requires ten minutes of operation and consumes one type A power cell. Most vacc freshers are also equipped with an emergency hand crank power source, though it requires at least two hours of cranking.'
