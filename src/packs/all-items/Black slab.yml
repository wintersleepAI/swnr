  description: 'Black slab: While a “black slab” appears to be a normal dataslab to casual examination, these devices are packed with intrusion-optimization hardware and integral line tapping tools. They function as a metatool for purposes of accessing data lines and grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made with them. They are also quite illegal on most worlds, available only from black market dealers and private sales from hackers.'
