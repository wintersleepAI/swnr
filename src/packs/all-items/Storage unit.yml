  description: 'Storage unit: While conventional dataslabs have ample space to hold any reasonable amount of data, sometimes a party needs to store or acquire a truly huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm, capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single storage unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that has been carefully compressed and optimized for it. If the user is simply ripping a database off a network and stuffing it into the unit, it can absorb up to a small corporationâ€™s complete files.'
