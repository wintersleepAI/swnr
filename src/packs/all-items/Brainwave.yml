  description: 'Brainwave (Heal-2): This psitech drug requires advanced TL5 facilities to compound, and the few remaining doses from pre-Silence periods are rarely available on the open market. Application of Brainwave gives a psychic 2 extra maximum Effort for one hour. At the end of that hour, they suffer 4 points of System Strain. If their Strain is maximized by this, they go unconscious for one hour. Only one dose can be active at a time.'
