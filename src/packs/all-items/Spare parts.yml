  description: 'Spare parts: This is a general category for a number of small TL4 components and repair materials. While a simple toolkit or metatool is often enough to fix a damaged object, severely broken devices may need replacement parts. Rather than keep a catalog of bits and pieces, a technician can simply bring along one or more units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM decides that a repair effort requires more than existing salvage can support. A unit of spare parts can also be used to jury-rig some basic, uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such bodged devices rarely last longer than one scene.'
