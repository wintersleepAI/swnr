  description: 'Navcomp: A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers, astronomic charts, and gyroscopes packed into a flat, one-kilo case. A character with a navcomp will never get lost on worlds with GPS satellites. They can also make a crude but serviceable automatic map of all buildings or landscapes they travel through. Other terrestrial navigation skill checks are made at a +1 bonus.'
