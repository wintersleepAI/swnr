  description: 'Trade goods: Glowbugs, ceramic fire lighters, antibiotics, ceraplast tools, and the other fruits of a TL4 civilization that might be valuable on more primitive worlds. A kilo of trade goods can usually be traded for at least a hundred credits worth of local products on more primitive worlds that are not well-served by interstellar merchants. The profit margin shrinks rapidly as interstellar trade becomes more common, and there is always the difficulty of finding local products that are actually worth a merchantâ€™s journey.'
