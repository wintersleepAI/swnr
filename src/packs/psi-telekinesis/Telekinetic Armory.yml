  description: <p>The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to create both weapons and armor out of telekinetic force. These weapons are treated as tech level 4 and act as a rifle or any advanced melee weapon. Attack rolls can use either Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution modifiers, and may use the Telekinesis skill as the combat skill.</p><p>Armor may be created as part of this power, granting the psychic a base Armor Class equal to 15 plus their Telekinesis skill level. This armor does not stack with conventional armor, but Dexterity or shields modify it as usual. The gear continues to exist as long as the psychic chooses to leave the Effort committed, and they may be invisible or visible at the psychicâ€™s discretion.</p>
