  description: >-
    <p>As an Instant action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort to begin flying,
    and may extend this effect to up to a half-dozen unresisting, human-sized
    allies within 30 meters. While flying, the psychic can move at twice their
    normal movement rate in any direction They can plunge earthward at up to
    terminal velocity without harm, and even orbital insertions are survivable
    with this power if a vacc suit is available or the <em>Pressure Field</em>
    technique is used. Allies must end their turns within 30 meters of the
    psychic to maintain this flight but control their own motion. As an Instant,
    this power may be triggered in time to negate falling damage. The flight
    lasts for as long as the Effort remains Committed.</p>
