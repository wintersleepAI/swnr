  description: >-
    <p>As an Instant action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene
    whenever an assailant misses them with a physical attack. The attack is then
    reflected back against the assailant, who must reroll the attack against
    their own person twice. If either roll hits, the assailant suffers damage
    from their own attack. If both rolls hit, the damage is the maximum
    possible.</p>
