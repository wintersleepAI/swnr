  description: <p>Telekinetic power involves kinetic energy, but a sufficiently sophisticated grip on motion can be used to agitate the molecules of an inanimate object and cause it to melt or burst into flame. Similar focus can chill or freeze such substances.</p><p>Applying <em>Thermokinesis</em> to a target requires that the adept Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action. <em>Thermokinesis</em> cannot affect objects larger than the adept could lift with their <em>Telekinetic Manipulation</em>.</p><p>As with other telekinetic powers, this ability does not work on objects being held or used by intelligent creatures. Non-sentient robots or other objects with hit points take 1d12 damage per level of Telekinesis skill each time this technique is applied to them.</p>
