  description: <p>As a Main Action, the psychic can Commit Effort for the scene to target a tremendous, uncontrolled burst of force at a single target within sight. This burst requires some time to detonate, however, and will only go off at the end of the next round. Targets of this technique are aware of an oppressive, electrical tingling in the air and are apt to instinctively move; this technique is thus generally useless against any target that is not entirely immobile, as any movement of a chosen target disrupts the ram. Once the ram detonates, however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile civilian vehicle, create a five-meter hole in anything short of hardened military fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else as if it were struck by a Heavy weapon.</p>
