  description: An armored vacc suit has traded off some comfort and flexibility for additional protective thickness. Aside from functioning as a normal vacc suit, it has only half the usual chance to tear when hit by an edged weapon or suit ripper. The choice between armored or standard suits is a common debate in spacer bars.
