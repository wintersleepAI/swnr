  description: The Icarus harness is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a conventional parachute with a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3 meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh.
