  description: A “vestimentum” is a catch-all term for one of the many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against primitive weapons as any other powered armor.
