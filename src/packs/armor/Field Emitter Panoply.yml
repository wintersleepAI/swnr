  description: A field emitter panoply is a heavy-duty pretech defensive system composed of a half-dozen worn emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of close-fitting damper fields. The FEP’s pale glow is obvious, but it provides all the benefits of storm armor with no power source required. The FEP is particularly effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer immune to any dose that wouldn’t kill them in seconds. Many FEPs project intimidating holographic skins over the wearer when in operation.
