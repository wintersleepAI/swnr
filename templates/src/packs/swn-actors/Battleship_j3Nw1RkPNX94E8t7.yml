  description: >-
    Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can create, only the
    richest modern worlds can afford to fabricate these massive engines of war.
    Even those worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at expending
    such a tremendous amount of money on a single ship. Those that do build
    battleships do so for a reason. The tremendous weight of fire these ships
    put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull
    plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers
    often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly
    require hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.  The main weakness of a
    battleship is the fact that it is only a single shipâ€¦ a single, extremely
    expensive ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time,
    and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized
    anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the
    battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it.

        Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures can be used to
        forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided the targetâ€™s engines have been
        disabled. Ships without boarding tubes have to send invaders across
        empty space to either make an assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded
        airlock or cut their way in through the hull with laser cutters and half
        an hour of work.

        Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and extraction of hydrogen from gas
        giants or the penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process requires
        four days of processing and refinement, but completely refuels the ship.
        Such fittings are common on explorer craft that cannot expect to find
        refueling stations.

        Forging new spike courses is too much an art to rely on computerized
        assistance, but an advanced nav computer can help on well-mapped routes.
        When navigating an interstellar drill course with charts less than a
        year old, the navigator decreases drill difficulty by 2.

        These sophisticated docking bays provide all the necessary tools and
        support for launching a starship from the mother craft. They are rarely
        seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers, but some cruisers make
        room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay allows room for
        one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the carried ship can
        support its own crew if necessary, most carriers fold their space wing
        into the mothership's crew roster. This fitting can be taken multiple
        times.
