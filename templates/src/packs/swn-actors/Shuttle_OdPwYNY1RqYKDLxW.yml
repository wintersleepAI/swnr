  description: >-
    This craft is a conventional civilian shuttle, albeit one with a spike drive
    sufficient to get it to a neighboring system and enough passenger space to
    make it a minimally- acceptable transport for brave VIPs and light cargo. If
    used as an inter-system transport, however, at least three crew will be
    needed to safely navigate a drill. While cheap and flexible, the shuttle is
    entirely unarmed and acutely vulnerable to piracy or hostile warships. In
    such cases the pilot’s only recourse is to surrender or hope the small
    craft’s nimble maneuver drives can keep it away from the attacker long
    enough to get to safety.

        The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew or
        passengers. Extended life support can be fitted multiple times; each
        time, the maximum crew rating of the ship increases by 100% of its
        normal maximum. Thus, a free merchant who installs this twice can have a
        maximum complement of 18 people.
