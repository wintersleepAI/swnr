  description: >-
    You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This
    focus’ benefits do not apply to unarmed attacks or projectile weapons. For
    thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same
    time as Gunslinger.<br><br>Level 1: Gain Stab as a bonus skill. You can draw
    or sheath a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant action. You may add
    your Stab skill level to a melee or thrown weapon’s damage roll or Shock
    damage, assuming it has any to begin with.<br>Level 2: Your primitive melee
    and thrown weapons count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming
    advanced armors. Even on a miss with a melee weapon, you do an unmodified
    1d4 damage to the target, plus any Shock damage. This bonus damage doesn’t
    apply to thrown weapons or attacks that use the Punch skill.
