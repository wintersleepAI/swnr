  description: >-
    You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike
    drills. While most experienced pilots can manage conventional drills along
    well-charted spike routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths
    and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.<br><br>Level 1:
    Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically succeed at all spike
    drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.<br>Level 2: Double your
    Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks. Spike drives of ships
    you navigate are treated as one level higher; thus, a drive-1 is treated as
    a drive-2, up to a maximum of drive-7. Spike drills you personally oversee
    take only half the time they would otherwise require.
