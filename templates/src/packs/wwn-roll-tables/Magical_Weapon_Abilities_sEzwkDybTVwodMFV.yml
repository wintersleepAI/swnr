      Adamantine: The weapon is imperishable and unbreakable by all conventional
      and most magical means. Edged weapons never lose their keenness,
      bowstrings never snap, and the weapon can bear a seemingly limitless
      amount of weight without bending or breaking. The weapon’s damage and hit
      bonus are both increased by +1, to a maximum of +3.

      Baffling: The weapon looks very strange in some way, and its operation is
      not obvious to onlookers. The first attack the wielder makes during a
      fight is an automatic hit; after that, the onlookers have seen enough to
      defend against it normally. The shifting configuration of the weapon
      allows the same bonus during the next fight, however, even if the foes
      have seen it in an earlier engagement.

      Barring: As a Move action, the bearer can use the weapon to draw a
      straight, glowing line up to twenty feet long, provided one part of the
      line is within five feet of the bearer. Enemies must make a Mental saving
      throw to cross the line from either direction with their bodies, weapons,
      or powers; on a failed save, their attempted action is wasted. The effect
      ends until a new line is draw, the scene ends, or the bearer or their
      allies cross the line with their own bodies, weapons, or powers.

      Blighted: The weapon was created to slaughter normal human beings. Against
      baseline humans, it rolls damage twice and takes the better result. It
      functions without issues even in the hands of a baseline wielder; its
      creators were as glad to see intercine strife as any other kind.

      Bloodbound: The weapon forms a symbiotic bond with the wielder. So long as
      they are wielding the weapon, they automatically stabilize from any
      survivable mortal wound and automatically regenerate one hit point every
      hour as magical healing. Once per day, a failed Physical or Mental saving
      throw may be rerolled as the weapon shares the strain on the wielder.

      Devoted: The weapon bonds with the first possessor to pick it up after the

      zero hit points during a day, they may accept a point of System Strain to

      sort the weapon could block.

      Marking: When the weapon harms or even touches a target, the wielder can
      choose to gain a point of System Strain and activate its marking power.
      For the rest of the scene, the weapon can strike the target as if they
      were adjacent, regardless of their distance or any intervening cover. They
      are also perfectly aware of the marked target’s location, speech, and
      physical actions. The mark ends at the end of the scene, when a new target
      is marked, or when the marked target gets more than five hundred feet away

      Omened: Once per day the weapon can provide a yes, no, or unclear answer
      to a single question asked by a wielder regarding events that could happen
      to the wielder within the next hour. The weapon’s answer is the GM’s best
      estimate of likelihood, and may not be correct if events play out in an
      unexpected way. Thus, asking “Will I win this hand of cards?” might result
      in the GM dicing out the result and telling the PC yes or no based on what
      will happen should they play, but if the PC knifes their gambling partner
      partway through the draw the weapon’s answer would no longer apply.

      Terrifying: The weapon is wrought with psychic distress, creating an
      intense burden of fear in those who oppose its wielder. Whenever the
      wielder does something that provokes a Morale or Instinct check, any
      targets who can see them must make the check at a -1 penalty. This effect
      does not stack with multiple weapons, nor does it affect those with Morale
      12.

      Toxic: The weapon sweats a potent toxin. When it hits a living target, the
      wielder may accept a point of System Strain to trigger the toxin’s effect;
      the victim is racked with spasms of torment and cannot speak or cry out
      while they remain poisoned. Each round they take 1d8 damage at the end of
      their turn; they can try to throw off the poison’s effects by making a
      successful Physical saving throw at the end of their round. A creature can
      only be poisoned once by this weapon at any one time.

      Vengeful: The weapon will always succeed at any attack roll made against a
      foe who has harmed the wielder within the past round, assuming success is
      physically possible. Such vengeful strikes roll damage twice and take the
      higher roll.

      Versatile: The weapon shifts forms to better suit the bearer’s need. As an
      On Turn action, the wielder can give it one of the following qualities it
      doesn’t already have: Subtle, Long, or Throwable. If thrown, it returns to
      the bearer’s hand at the end of the round.

      Vigilant: The weapon’s bearer cannot be surprised by anyone who is
      carrying a manufactured weapon. The bearer does not need to sleep, though
      they do not recover lost hit points or accumulated System Strain without
      doing so.
