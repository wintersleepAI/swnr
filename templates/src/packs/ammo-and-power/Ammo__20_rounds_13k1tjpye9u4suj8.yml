  description: >-
    Ammunition: A few worlds are too primitive or too resource-poor to
    manufacture ammunition, but the vast majority of worlds provide cartridges
    in almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most local gunsmiths can load
    ammunition to any specification required by a buyer.
