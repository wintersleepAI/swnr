  description: >-
    <p>As a Main Action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort for the day to suborn
    a visible target’s mobility, whether robotic, vehicular, or human, provided
    it’s no larger than a ground car. A sapient victim can make a Mental saving
    throw to resist the psychic onslaught; on a failure, they lose control of
    their physical actions. If not piloted by the telekinetic, the target
    remains motionless or continues on its current direction of travel. If the
    telekinetic spends a Main Action to control them, they can be made to
    perform any physical action that is not directly suicidal, using the
    psychic’s skill levels and hit bonus for any attacks or skill checks they
    might make. The puppetry lasts until the end of the scene, until the target
    leaves the psychic’s sight, or until a sapient target believes that their
    action or inaction is about to get them killed. The psychic’s control is
    fine enough to achieve even very delicate physical motions, but it is not
    good enough to control the target’s speech, though it can keep them
    silent.</p>
