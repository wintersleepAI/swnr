  description: >-
    Duration: Instant Range: 10' The caster or a chosen creature vanishes and
    reappears at a location of the caster's choosing. ▶ Gear: The subject is
    teleported with all its gear, up to its maximum load. ▶ Unwilling subjects:
    May make a Mental save to prevent the teleportation. ▶ Destination: May be
    at any distance, but must be known to the caster. The destination must be an
    open space at ground level. (It is not possible to intentionally teleport
    the subject into mid-air or into solid matter.) ▶ Risk: There is a risk,
    when teleporting, of accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The
    chance of a successful teleportation depends on the caster's knowledge of
    the destination (see right). Roll d% and consult the table below. Knowledge
    of Destination Ground Level Too High Too Low Scant 01-50 51-75 76-100
    Moderate 01-80 81-90 91-100 Exact 01-95 96-99 100 Ground level: The subject
    appears at the desired destination. Too high: The subject appears
    1d10&times;10' above the intended destination. Should this location already
    be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly killed. Otherwise, the
    subject falls from a height. Too low: The subject appears in the ground and
    is killed instantly. Knowledge of destination: The caster's knowledge of the
    destination is rated as follows: ▶ Scant: A location that the caster has
    visited once or twice, has seen by magical scrying, or has heard of from
    descriptions. ▶ Moderate: A location that the caster has visited often or
    has studied via scrying for several weeks. ▶ Exact: A location that the
    caster has made a detailed study of, in person.
