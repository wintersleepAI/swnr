  description: >-
    These small paintings, figurines, or symbolic statuettes were designed to
    influence the most primitive, basic levels of human cogitation in order to
    impress a particular complex idea on the beholder. Their effectiveness waned
    with human changes over the ages, but they still have a powerful ability to
    influence the unwary. When a human or demihuman first sees a Vothite icon
    within thirty feet of them, they must make a Mental saving throw; on a
    failure, they lose their next round of action as they struggle to comprehend
    the alien imperative the icon is impressing on their thoughts. These ideals
    are so strange and anachronistic that they are almost always rejected, but
    it takes the full round to do so. The same icon can't affect the same
    creature twice. Lifting and presenting an icon requires one hand and a Main
    Action.
