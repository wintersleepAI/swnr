    You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This
    Focus' benefits do not apply to unarmed attacks or non-thrown projectile
    weapons. This Focus' bonuses also don't stack with Deadeye or other Foci
    that add a skill's level to your damage or Shock. Level 1: Gain Stab as a
    bonus skill. You can Ready a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant
    action. You may add your Stab skill level to a melee or thrown weapon's
    damage roll or Shock damage, assuming it has any to begin with. Level 2: The
    Shock from your melee attacks always treats the target as if they have AC
    10. Gain a +1 bonus to hit with all thrown or melee attacks.
