  description: >-
    Your bloodline was reshaped into a caste of toilers and brute laborers for
    some more powerful group. While you are less badly afflicted than most of
    your kind, your mental faculties remain duller than most baseline humans and
    you have an instinctive urge to obey orders and instructions. Level 1: Gain
    Exert as a bonus skill. Each of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
    attribute modifiers suffers a -1 penalty, down to a minimum of -2, while
    your Strength and Constitution modifiers are improved by +1, up to a maximum
    of +3 for each. You require only half as much food and rest as a normal
    human. You suffer a -2 penalty to all Mental saving throws to resist
    mind-influencing effects.
