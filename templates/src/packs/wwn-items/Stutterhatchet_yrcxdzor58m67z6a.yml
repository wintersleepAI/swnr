  description: >-
    This small workman's hatchet has a flat hammer-poll on its opposite side and
    a blade that cannot be dulled by anything short of intentional effort to
    damage it. It functions as a hand axe +1 if used in combat, but when applied
    to inanimate objects its true function becomes plain. Whatever inanimate
    matter the stutterhatchet damages, smashes, or cuts will return to its
    perfect, unbroken state at the next dawn, or sooner if the flat of the axe
    is tapped against a fragment of it. Fragments or pieces of the object will
    disappear when the object reforms. If the object is broken into several
    pieces, it is restored around the largest one, or around the one the wielder
    taps with the hatchet if it's triggered early. If fragments are burned,
    melted, or destroyed with equivalent thoroughness they will be missing from
    the reformed object.
