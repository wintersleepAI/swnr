  description: >-
    The necromancer conjures a blast of dispelling force at a point within one
    hundred feet per caster level, affecting an area up to 20 feet in radius.
    All hostile undead within that area immediately suffer 1d10 damage per
    caster level. Undead with hit dice equal or less than the caster's level
    must make a Physical save or be destroyed outright. The necromancer may
    Commit Effort for the day immediately after casting this spell to restore it
    to their mind for use again.
