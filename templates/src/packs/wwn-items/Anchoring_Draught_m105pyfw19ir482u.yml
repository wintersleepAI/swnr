  description: >-
    When a subject drinks this elixir, they become spatially anchored to the
    place at which they drank it. At any time within the following twenty-four
    hours, they may teleport back to this point as a Main Action, along with any
    objects, willing subjects, or incapacitated creatures they are carrying,
    provided it's within ten miles. This teleportation can be done only once,
    and if the target point is blocked by a solid object the shift fails.
