  description: >-
    This small gemstone is impossible to mistake for an ordinary jewel, for it
    fills all onlookers with an overwhelming desire to obtain it. If found as
    treasure or plunder, the finders can decide calmly who is to have it, but if
    it is offered to a person in exchange for some favor or service that some
    amount of wealth could theoretically compel them to do, the would-be
    recipient must make a Mental saving throw or agree to perform the act in
    exchange for the jewel. If they receive the jewel, they will faithfully
    carry out the spirit of the agreement for at least a week. The jewel's full
    bewitchment of them will last for at most a week, after which they will be
    able to think clearly about whether or not the trade was reasonable and
    worth it.
