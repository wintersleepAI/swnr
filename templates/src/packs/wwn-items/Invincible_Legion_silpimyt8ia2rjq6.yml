  description: >-
    The faction has developed a truly irresistible military organization that
    can smash its way through opposition without the aid of any support units.
    During a Relocate Asset action, the Invincible Legion can relocate to
    locations that would otherwise not permit a formal military force to
    relocate there, as if it had the Subtle quality. It is not, however, in any
    way subtle.
