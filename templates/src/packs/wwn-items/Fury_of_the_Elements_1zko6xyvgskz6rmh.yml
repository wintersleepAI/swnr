  description: >-
    A combination of molten rock, searing pyroclastic winds, and superheated
    steam erupts forth to ravage a chosen target point within two hundred feet
    per caster level. The cataclysmic ruin smites everything within thirty feet
    of the target point for 10d6 damage, destroying all conventional structures.
    The zone of devastation then moves 60 feet in a random direction at the
    start of the next round, blasting everything in its path. The zone will
    continue to wander in this fashion for [[/roll 1d6]] rounds in total before
    dying out. The molten remnants of the spell remain after this duration, a
    hazard for whomever enters the area for the rest of the day.
