    Gear Bundles Depending on the tastes of the group, some parties might enjoy
    tracking every torch and carefully weighing their resource expenditures on
    perilous expeditions. Others prefer to gloss over the details. The "gear
    bundle" options below cover all the non-weapon, non-armor gear expected of a
    particular role and the usual encumbrance weight of it all. The specific
    contents of each bundle are as broad as the GM finds reasonable for the
    role. A GM who prefers exact accounting can disallow bundles.
