    Shields come in two general varieties. Small ones, often made of costlier
    metal, can be strapped to the wearer's arm and allow them to hold and
    manipulate objects with that hand, albeit not wield a weapon with it. Larger
    shields are of cheaper wood and require a good grip. A small shield user has
    a base AC of 13, while a large shield user has a base AC of 14. Unlike other
    armor, however, if the user is already wearing equal or better armor the
    shield grants a +1 bonus to their AC. Shields allow the bearer to ignore the
    first instance of Shock they might otherwise suffer in a round.
