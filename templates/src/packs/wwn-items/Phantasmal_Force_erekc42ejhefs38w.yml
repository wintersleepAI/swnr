    Duration: Concentration Range: 240' A visual illusion of the caster's
    choosing manifests in a 20' cube area. Three types of illusions may be
    created: 1. An illusionary monster: That can be directed to attack. The
    monster has an Armour Class of 10 and will vanish if hit in combat. 2. An
    illusionary attack: For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
    missile, etc. Targets who make a Mental save are unaffected. 3. A scene:
    Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the
    appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched. Stipulations:
    The following apply: ▶ Concentration: Is required to maintain the illusion.
    If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends. ▶ Illusionary
    monsters or attacks: May appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever
    inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a
    character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such
    effects last for 1d4 turns. ▶ Illusions from imagination: If the illusion is
    of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant
    targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.
