  description: >-
    When imbibed, the user is prompted to think of a particular time and place
    in their own past. They are instantly whisked back to a perfect temporal
    parallel of that time, occupying the body they had at the time for one hour.
    During that hour they may do as they wish in that time and place, but if
    they die during that hour, they die in the present as well. At the hour's
    end their mind is returned to the present time. Nothing that happened in the
    facsimile remains or has any effect on true reality, but things they learned
    or observed during that hour may be retained.
