  description: >-
    Hired mercenaries and professional soldiers, this Asset can, as a free
    action once per turn, move itself. At the start of each of its owner's turn,
    it takes 1 Treasure in upkeep costs; if this is not paid, roll 1d6. On a 1-3
    the Asset is lost, on a 4-6 it goes rogue and will move to Attack the most
    profitable-looking target. This roll is repeated each turn until back pay is
    paid or the Asset is lost.
