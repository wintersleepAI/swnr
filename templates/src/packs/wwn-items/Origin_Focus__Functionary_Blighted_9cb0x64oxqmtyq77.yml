  description: >-
    Your ancestors were created as tools for a specific functional purpose, one
    more specific than that of a general laborer. Some may have been living
    musical instruments, while others could be warped maintenance-drones,
    inhuman performers, tireless living calculators, or some similar
    purpose-grown organism. While you probably still look somewhat human, most
    such functionaries suffered significant, crippling debilities to gain their
    powers. These Blighted are naturally equipped with the tools and abilities
    necessary to carry out their role, either as physical organs, implanted
    devices, or innate magical powers. Level 1: Pick any one non-combat,
    non-Magic skill as a bonus skill and gain the Specialist Focus in it. Pick
    any one attribute; it suffers a -1 penalty to its modifier, to a minimum of
    -2. You are capable of carrying out your intended function even without
    normally-necessary tools or instruments; functionaries intended to be
    artisans can replicate or mimic hand tools, those meant to be healers do not
    need medical supplies, and so forth. You gain an intrinsic +1 bonus to all
    skill checks related to your function.
