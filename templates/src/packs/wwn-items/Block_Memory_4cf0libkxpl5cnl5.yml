  description: >-
    Target a visible living creature and Commit Effort for the day as a Main
    Action while specifying a particular event or situation that didn't extend
    longer than a scene. The target gets a Mental saving throw; on a failure,
    they simply cannot remember the event and will construct a plausible false
    memory to paper over the gap. The memory can be restored by use of this
    power once more or a magical dispelling ability, but detecting the
    alteration is difficult; any power that detects enchantments on a target
    does so with a +2 difficulty penalty to any skill check made to discern the
    ban.
