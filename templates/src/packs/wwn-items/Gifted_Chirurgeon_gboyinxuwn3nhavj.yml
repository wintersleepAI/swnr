  description: >-
    You have an unusual gift for saving mortally-wounded allies and quickening
    the natural recovery of the wounded in your care. Level 1: Gain Heal as a
    bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one Mortally Wounded adjacent
    person per round as an On Turn action. When rolling Heal skill checks, roll
    3d6 and drop the lowest die. You heal twice as many hit points as usual when
    applying first aid after a battle, as described on page 48. Level 2: Your
    curative gifts count as magical healing. You can heal 1d6+Heal skill in
    damage to an adjacent wounded ally as a Main Action. Each such application
    of healing adds 1 System Strain to the target, and the gift cannot be used
    on targets already at their maximum System Strain.
