  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. For the remainder of the
    scene you may move up vertical and overhanging surfaces and across difficult
    terrain at your full movement rate with no chance of slipping or falling,
    provided the surface is not glass-smooth or enchanted. You require only one
    free hand to cling to a wall or ceiling.
