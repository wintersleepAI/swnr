  description: >-
    Your hero has some unusual ability or magical knack that can't be adequately
    described by an existing Focus. This choice is a catch-all meant to
    represent a special power that's in some way worth a Focus pick. The exact
    effect of the ability should be defined by the player and the GM together,
    working out some result that seems fair and reasonable. This will vary from
    table to table and from campaign to campaign; an innate ability to breathe
    water is little more than a novelty in a desert setting, while a campaign
    based on piracy in an endless archipelago might make it far more
    significant. As with any power, the group should be willing to reconsider
    the gift if it turns out to be exceptionally weak in play or a stronger
    power than was anticipated.
