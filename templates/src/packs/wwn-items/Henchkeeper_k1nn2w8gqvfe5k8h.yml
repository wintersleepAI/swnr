  description: >-
    You have a distinct knack for picking up lost souls who willingly do your
    bidding. You might induce them with promises of money, power, excitement,
    sex, or some other prize that you may or may not eventually grant. A
    henchman obtained with this Focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly
    betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not "important"
    people in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the
    desperate, or other persons with few options. You can use more conventional
    pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings
    are no more loyal or competent than your pay and treatment can purchase.
    Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within 24
    hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench
    material. These henchmen will not fight except to save their own lives, but
    will escort you on adventures and risk great danger to help you. Most
    henchmen from a civilized society will be treated as Peaceful Humans from
    the bestiary section of the book. You can have one henchmen at a time for
    every three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release henchmen
    with no hard feelings at any plausible time and pick them back up later
    should you be without a current henchman. Level 2: Your henchmen are
    remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you against anything but
    clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural competence or their
    devotion to you, they're treated as Veteran Soldiers from the bestiary
    section. You can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable
    NPCs, but this requires that you actually have done them some favor or help
    that would reasonably earn such fierce loyalty.
