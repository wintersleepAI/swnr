  description: >-
    A visible target within a hundred feet is immediately teleported to any
    visible, solid resting point within a half-mile, provided the target point
    has enough room to accept them and it is not a position of imminent physical
    peril. Unattended objects can be translocated by the spell, but they can be
    no larger than a horse. Unwilling creatures targeted by this spell may make
    a Mental saving throw to resist; on a success, it is the caster who is
    transported to the intended destination instead.
