  description: >-
    This shape has an arboreal agility when it comes to climbing. You can travel
    up sheer surfaces at your usual movement rate provided at least three limbs
    are available for use and the surface is not glassily smooth. If you fall,
    you can halt your plunge without damage so long as a serviceable surface to
    cling to is within ten feet of you.
