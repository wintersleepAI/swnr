  description: >-
    You have considerable gifts as a crafter and know numerous secrets for
    employing arcane salvage and magical materials. You are able to create mods
    for equipment even if you are not an Expert, as per the rules on page 56.
    Level 1: Gain Craft as a bonus skill. Your Craft skill is treated as one
    level higher, up to a maximum of 5, for purposes of crafting and maintaining
    mods. Mods you build require one fewer unit of arcane salvage, down to a
    minimum of one. Level 2: The first mod you add to an item requires no
    Maintenance and only half the silver piece price usually required. This
    benefit is in addition to the benefits of installing a mod in masterwork
    gear you build. You automatically succeed at any attempt to build masterwork
    gear appropriate to your background or past practice, and once per month you
    can reduce a created mod's salvage price by one further unit, down to a
    minimum of zero.
