  description: >-
    At your discretion, creatures within twenty feet of you per character level
    that are Mortally Wounded will die instantly and cannot be revived by magic
    or medicine. Conversely, you can Commit Effort for the day to automatically
    stabilize any or all within that range, increasing their System Strain by 1
    point. This benefit cannot aid creatures that have been dismembered,
    shredded, or otherwise suffered unsurvivable injuries.
