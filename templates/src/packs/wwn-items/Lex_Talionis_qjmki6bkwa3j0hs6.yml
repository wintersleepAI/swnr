  description: >-
    These rare magical weapons come in various small, concealable forms, with
    daggers predominating. They function as ordinary +1 magical weapons in the
    main, but whenever they cause harm to a target, the victim must make a
    Physical saving throw. On a failure, both the target and the wielder of the
    Lex Talionis instantly die, with no chance to stabilize. If the weapon is
    used as part of an Execution Attack, no saving throw is allowed. The weapon
    then vanishes; some say that it is destroyed by the magical discharge, while
    others postulate that it simply appears elsewhere to await a new avenger.
