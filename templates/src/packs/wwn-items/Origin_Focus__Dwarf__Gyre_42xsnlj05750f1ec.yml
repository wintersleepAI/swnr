  description: >-
    Your PC is a dwarf, a demihuman weapon-race devised during the ancient rule
    of the Outsiders. You are probably a recusant from some dwarven polity,
    though it could be you are a loyal believer in your homeland's ideals who
    simply wants to see more of the world before returning home and helping in
    their Great Plan. Level 1: Gain Craft as a bonus skill. You have the dwarven
    surrounding-sense out to twenty feet, able to distinguish solid objects as
    if you were using your sense of sight. You have a natural resistance to
    magic, gaining a +2 bonus on all saves against hostile magical effects. You
    need only half the usual amount of food, water, and air and gain a +1 bonus
    to your hit point die at each level. Level 2: You have such a deep
    connection with your dwarven nature that once per day, as an Instant action,
    you can simply negate an unwanted magical effect that would otherwise affect
    you. If you accept one System Strain point, you can use this ability to
    negate a magical effect you can see or otherwise sense, provided it's within
    one hundred feet. This ability applies only to spellcasting, relatively
    minor standing enchantments, and creature-generated magic; it cannot negate
    Workings, suppress magic items, or nullify effects created by magic items or
    exceptionally potent rituals. Note that NPC dwarves of more than 2 hit dice
    will also have this ability.
