    Duration: One conversation Range: The caster A channel of communication is
    opened to a higher plane of existence, allowing the caster to ask powerful,
    otherworldly beings for advice and knowledge on any subject. ▶ Plane: The
    caster must choose which plane of existence to contact: communion with
    beings of the 3rd to 12th planes is possible via this spell. Higher numbered
    planes are home to more powerful and knowledgeable beings. ▶ Questions: The
    caster may then ask a number of simple yes/no questions equal to the number
    of the plane contacted. The referee plays the role of the contacted being,
    responding to the caster's questions. ▶ Answers: For each question asked,
    there is a chance of the contacted being not knowing the answer or of
    answering untruthfully: see the table to the right. It is impossible to
    detect whether the entity is lying. Restrictions: Casting contact higher
    plane is a great and perilous deed. ▶ Usage limit: It may be cast at most
    once per week. (The referee may limit the spell's usage to even less
    frequently, if desired.) ▶ Insanity: Communion with otherworldly beings of
    great power can shatter the caster's sanity. The basic chance is shown in
    the table above. For every level of the caster above 11, this chance is
    reduced by 5%. If the caster is driven insane as a result of the communion,
    the recovery time is a number of weeks equal to the number of the plane
    contacted. Plane #Qs Don't Know Truth Insanity 3rd 3 75% 50% 5% 4th 4 70%
