  description: >-
    You are a sentient undead creature that is capable of masquerading as a
    normal human, assuming no one inspects you too closely. Optionally, you can
    perfectly mimic a living person, but you must then choose one debility or
    vulnerability from the prior list of qualities. As with any other origin
    Focus, it's up to the GM to decide whether to permit this origin in their
    campaign. Level 1: You have all the qualities of an undead creature. You can
    teach your allies how to successfully use healing effects on you. The
    debilitating effects of death have lessened you; pick an attribute and lower
    its modifier by -1, to a minimum of -2. Level 2: Pick one trait to gain: you
    can mimic the living with no penalty or drawback, you can turn Intangible as
    an On Turn action for one round per scene, you can use Desynchrony once per
    scene as an Instant action, you become immune to Shock, or some similar
    undead-style power with GM approval. This level of Focus may be taken more
    than once.
