  description: >-
    Unlike most Anak, you are capable of functioning in human society, either
    through a weakened sense of Hate or an overwhelming force of will. Unless
    your appearance is much more human than most, however, you may have an
    extremely difficult time in human lands. Level 1: Gain Stab and Punch as
    bonus skills. Your Strength and Constitution modifiers increase by +1, up to
    a maximum of +2. Your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers decrease by -1, to a
    minimum of -2.
