  description: >-
    Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the Effort is maintained and until
    you take some hostile action against a creature, you are immune to Shock
    damage and gain a +4 bonus to your Armor Class and all saving throws.
    Enemies must pass an Instinct check each round to target you with attacks;
    on a failure, they may take some other action instead. Once this art is
    ended it cannot be reactivated for the rest of the scene. Healing and other
    indirect support of fighting comrades does not count as a hostile action.
