  description: >-
    This spell may be cast as an On Turn spell, provided no other has been cast
    this round, and targets a single willing or helpless creature the caster is
    touching. The subject is shifted out of the flow of conventional time,
    freezing and being limned in a pale sepia light. They and all their carried
    possessions are rendered impervious to all non-magical harm and are frozen
    in temporal stasis until the spell ends or is dispelled. Enchanted creatures
    are quite light, counting as only four items of Encumbrance due to their
    unwieldiness. The spell ends when the mage releases it, or up to a maximum
    of one day per caster level. If cast on himself, the mage cannot end it
    before the full duration expires.
