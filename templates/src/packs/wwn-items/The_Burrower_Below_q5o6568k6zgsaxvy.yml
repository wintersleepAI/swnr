  description: >-
    A passage is carved through natural stone or earth, forming a tunnel up to
    twenty feet long per caster level and up to ten feet wide and tall. The
    caster can cause the earth to compress and pack itself so as to stabilize
    the tunnel even in very sandy or burdened soil, or they can allow it to
    collapse naturally if burdened by some large structure or unstable
    surroundings. This spell can function against worked stone, but the length
    of the tunnel is much shorter, being only two feet per level. Magical stone
    or earth cannot be altered by this spell. The caster has basic control over
    the direction and interior features of the tunnel, and can form stairs or
    other simple structures within it.
