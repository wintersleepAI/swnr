  description: >-
    Great armor is less finely tailored, relying instead on stacking layer upon
    layer of mail, plates, hide, cloth, and other protective materials until a
    suit almost too heavy for movement is finally assembled. Heavy armor is the
    thickest, toughest panoply available on the market, and its bulk and noise
    make its encumbrance apply as a penalty to Sneak or Exert checks made by the
    wearer.
