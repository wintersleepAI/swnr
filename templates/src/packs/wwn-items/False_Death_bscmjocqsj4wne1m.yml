  description: >-
    Commit Effort as an Instant action; while it remains Committed you appear
    dead to all mundane examination. You lose your Main Actions while "dead",
    but can move and perceive normally and do not need to eat, drink, breathe,
    or perform other bodily functions. Poisons and diseases do not progress in
    you while you are "dead". You can maintain this state of death for up to one
    day per level before needing at least an hour to recover.
