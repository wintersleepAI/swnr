  description: >-
    You are a frenzy of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can hack down numerous
    lesser foes in close combat&hellip; assuming you survive being surrounded.
    Level 1: Gain Stab as a bonus skill. Once per scene, as an On Turn action,
    apply your Shock damage to all foes within melee range, assuming they're
    susceptible to your Shock. Level 2: The first time you kill someone in a
    round with a normal attack, either with its rolled damage on a hit or with
    the Shock damage it inflicts, instantly gain a second attack on any target
    within range using any Ready weapon you have.
