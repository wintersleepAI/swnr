  description: >-
    Duration: Special Range: The caster The caster's body enters a comatose
    trance as their life-force is transferred into a receptacle (any inanimate
    object within 30'), known as a magic jar. From there, the caster may attempt
    to possess the bodies of other creatures. When the caster's life-force is in
    the magic jar: ▶ Possession: The caster may attempt to possess the body of
    another creature within 120'. The victim may make a Mental save to resist
    possession. If the save is successful, the caster may not make another
    attempt to possess that victim for one turn. If the save fails, the caster's
    lifeforce leaves the magic jar and enters the victim, possessing it. ▶
    Returning: The caster may choose to return to their own body at any time,
    ending the spell. ▶ If the magic jar is destroyed: The caster dies. ▶ If the
    caster's own body is destroyed: Their life-force is stranded in the magic
    jar. When the caster's life-force is possessing a victim: ▶ Control: The
    caster gains full control over the victim's body, but is not able to make
    the victim cast spells. ▶ If the magic jar is destroyed: The spell ends and
    the caster's life-force is trapped in the possessed body. ▶ If the possessed
    victim is killed: The caster's life-force returns to the magic jar. ▶
    Dispelling: Dispel evil forces the caster's life-force back into the magic
    jar. ▶ If the caster's own body is destroyed: Their life-force is stranded
    in the body of the creature being possessed.
