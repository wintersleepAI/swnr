  description: >-
    This spell is cast in two parts, each of which must be cast separately
    within a mile of each other, though such paired use counts as only a single
    spell slot. The first casting inscribes a palm-sized seal of ruddy brown
    radiance on the ground beneath the caster. The second casting will
    immediately switch the caster and all creatures and objects within ten feet
    with all creatures and objects within ten feet of the sigil. The caster may
    refrain from swapping certain targets as they wish. Only portable objects
    are swapped; any object too heavy for the caster to lift or secured in place
    remains unmoved. Unwilling targets get no saving throw if they have four or
    less hit dice; others can make a Mental save. Unused sigils dissipate in a
    day.
