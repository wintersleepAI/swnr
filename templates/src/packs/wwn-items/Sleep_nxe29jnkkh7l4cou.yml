  description: >-
    Duration: [[4d4]] turns Range: 240' A sleep spell causes a magical slumber
    to come upon creatures, excluding the undead. The spell may target either: A
    single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice. A total of [[2d8]] Hit Dice of creatures
    of 4 HD or lower each. When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less, the
    following rules apply: ▶ Weakest first: Targets with the least HD are
    affected first. ▶ HD: Calculate monsters with less than 1 HD as having 1 HD
    and monsters with a bonus to HD as having the flat amount. (For example, a
    3+2 HD monster would be calculated as having 3 HD.) ▶ Excess: Rolled Hit
    Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Killing:
    Creatures enchanted by this spell are helpless and can be killed instantly
    with a bladed weapon. Awakening: Slapping or wounding awakens an affected
    creature.
