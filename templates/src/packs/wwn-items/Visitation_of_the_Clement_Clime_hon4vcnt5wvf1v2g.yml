  description: >-
    The caster and up to three visible allies per caster level are shielded from
    the excesses of hostile elemental energies, becoming immune to mundane
    extremes of heat and cold and natural acids or electrical discharges.
    Against magical harm of this nature, they automatically take only half the
    damage they normally would, or none if they make a successful Physical
    saving throw. This spell lasts for one hour per caster level.
