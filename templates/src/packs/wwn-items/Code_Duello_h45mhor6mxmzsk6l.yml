  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action when engaged with a single
    foe. So long as no other combatant attacks either your target or you, and
    you attack no one but your target, you gain a +4 bonus to your Armor Class
    and can roll your hit rolls twice, taking the better result. Once the Code
    Duello has been disrupted or ended, it cannot be invoked again during that
    scene.
