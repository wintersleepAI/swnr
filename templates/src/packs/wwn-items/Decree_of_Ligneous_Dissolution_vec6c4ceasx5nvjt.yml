  description: >-
    Wood, linen, cotton, rope, and other plant- or fungus-derived matter is
    annihilated by a wave of entropic force that washes through an area near the
    caster. The mage targets a point within one hundred feet per caster level
    and designates a number of contiguous 10-foot cubes within that area equal
    to or less than their caster level. All non-magical plant matter within that
    area immediately erodes away to dust. Enchanted objects of plant matter
    cannot be affected, but ordinary plant-based clothing, bows, or
    wooden-hafted weapons will be destroyed. If used against plant-based
    monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage per caster level, with a Physical save
    for half.
