  description: >-
    Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and target an intelligent
    creature known to you that is within two hundred feet per level. If they
    consent, you forge a telepathic link with them that can convey thoughts,
    speech, and images even without a common language. The link lasts for the
    rest of the scene. While linked with someone, both of you may reroll failed
    Mental saving throws and neither of you can be surprised unless both are.
