  description: >-
    The caster hurls up a magical shield that is impervious to almost all
    hostile powers. Unlike most sorceries, this spell can be cast as an Instant
    action, and immediately creates a transparent bubble of force around the
    caster with up to a twenty-foot radius. Entities and forces outside the
    bubble cannot penetrate it, and the interior remains a warm, breathable,
    safe environment regardless of the exterior. Those within the bubble can
    pass out of it, but they cannot then return within. The bubble can be
    dispelled by appropriate magics, but other enchantments and attacks cannot
    harm it, nor can magical effects or material objects pass through it from
    either direction. The spell lasts until the caster departs from the bubble.
