  description: >-
    Duration: Permanent (but may be broken, see below) Range: 240' The caster or
    another creature or object within range becomes invisible: ▶ If cast on a
    creature: Any gear the subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this
    includes clothing and armour). Items dropped or put down by an invisible
    creature become visible. If the subject attacks or casts a spell, the
    invisibility is broken, ending the spell. ▶ If cast on an object: The
    invisibility is permanent. ▶ Light sources: If a light source is made
    invisible (either as part of a creature's gear or as an individual object),
    the light it casts is unaffected.
