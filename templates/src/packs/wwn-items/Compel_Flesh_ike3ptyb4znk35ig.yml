  description: >-
    A visible living creature or physically-bodied undead within 100 feet is
    ensorceled by this spell, their flesh and bones becoming temporarily
    enthralled to the caster's will. The target becomes paralyzed unless
    commanded by the caster as an On Turn action; once given a command, their
    body will dutifully carry it out on their next turn. The user's mind is not
    affected by this spell, so they cannot be made to cast spells, answer
    questions, or perform other intellectual tasks, but they will fight, move,
    and perform other non-suicidal physical acts as normal. The target may make
    a Physical saving throw at the start of each of their turns to throw off the
    effect, but they will inevitably suffer one point of damage per caster level
    with each attempt as their flesh writhes and tears. If not thrown off
    earlier, the spell lasts until the end of the scene.
