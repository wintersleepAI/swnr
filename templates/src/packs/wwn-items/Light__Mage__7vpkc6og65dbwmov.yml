  description: >-
    Duration: 6 turns + 1 per level Range: 120' This spell has three usages:
    Conjuring light: In a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for
    reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
    object, in which case the light moves with the object. Blinding a creature:
    By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails an Evasion save, it
    is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack. Cancelling
    darkness: Light may cancel a darkness spell (see below). Reversed: Darkness
    Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but
    not infravision). Like light, it may alternatively be used to blind
    creatures or to dispel a light spell.
