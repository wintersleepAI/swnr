    man-portable gear may be carried per skill level in Teleportation. Allies
    must be within 3 meters of the teleporter to be carried along. Ordinary
    inert matter cannot be carried along unless the psychic is touching it or
    itâ€™s being carried by an ally affected by this power. If carrying inert
    mass, up to two hundred kilos of objects can be carried per
    skill</p><p>Level. Using this technique increases the Effort cost of
