  description: >-
    Data phase tap: This handheld device is normally illegal outside the
    possession of licensed data line repair technicians. The tap can detect data
    lines within five meters through up to ten centimeters of ordinary walls,
    and can generate an energy manipulation field that allows tapping that data
    line for hacking purposes without physically damaging the wall.
