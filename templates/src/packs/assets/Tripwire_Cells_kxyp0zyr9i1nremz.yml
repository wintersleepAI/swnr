  description: >-
    These observers are alert to the arrival of stealthed units. Whenever a
    stealthed asset lands or is purchased on a planet with tripwire cells, the
    Cells make an immediate Cunning vs. Cunning attack against the owning
    faction. If successful, the asset loses its stealth.
