  description: >-
    These advanced transport ships are capable of moving an asset long
    distances. As an action, any one non-Starship asset, including itself, can
    be moved between any two worlds within three hexes of the deep strike
    landers, at a cost of 2 FacCreds. This movement can be done even if the
    local planetary government objects, albeit doing so is usually an act of
    open war.
