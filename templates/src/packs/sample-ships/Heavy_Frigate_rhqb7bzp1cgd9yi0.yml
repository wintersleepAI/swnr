  description: >-
    Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavyfrigate pushes the
    engineering parameters of a frigate hull to the maximum available to most
    TL4 worlds. Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even
    cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate can intimidate any ship of its
    weight class. Its heavy crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow
    it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots throughout a solar
    system.  However, despite the large weapon loadout, the heavy frigate
    remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true
    cruiser-class warship, and most frigates built for same-class engagements
    can be a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a bludgeon
    against the other small warships likely to be fielded by a peer star-faring
    polity.
