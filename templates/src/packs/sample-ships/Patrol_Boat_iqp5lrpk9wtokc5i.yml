  description: >-
    Patrol boats are often the largest ships fielded by poor or backward
    frontier worlds that lack the shipyard fa- cilities or available resources
    to build bigger military craft. Even so, the ability to field two patrol
    boats for the yearly maintenance cost of one corvette often ap- peals even
    to richer worlds that need more coverage than their available craft can
    provide. 

    Patrol boats are the smallest independent warships fielded by most navies,
    as fighters are not normally considered capable of extended independent
    opera- tion. They have considerable spike drive reach and are faster
    in-system than most of their potential targets. While their single mounted
    gun is vulnerable to being disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively
    thick armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can mitigate that
    danger. A few patrol boats replace their survey sensor array with a
    sandthrower to up-gun the ship, but most prefer the additional edge in
    scanning potential smugglers.

        Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship equipment, a captain can

        integral maintenance facilities for its upkeep. There is enough gear

        Most ships require only basic analysis of a star system, sufficient to
        identify population centers, do rough scanning of an object’s
        composition, and chart major navigational hazards. Survey sensor arrays
        greatly enhance the ship’s sensor abilities, allowing for
        finely-detailed mapping of objects and planets, along with
        broad-spectrum communications analysis. They also improve attempts to
        detect other craft when scanning a region for stealthy vessels. Any
        rolls with survey sensor arrays add +2 to skill checks.
