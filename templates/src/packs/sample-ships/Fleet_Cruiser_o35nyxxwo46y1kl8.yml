  description: >-
    The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the fleet cruiser is a
    ship-eating monster compared to its smaller brethren in the navy. Only
    prosperous polities can build such powerful ships, and even they sometimes
    find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of small craft rather than a
    few heavily-armed cruisers. 

    The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily- armored hull. Only
    special hunter-killer ships fitted with armor-piercing weaponry have any
    real chance of penetrating the cruiser’s thick skin. Those weapons are
    almost always more bulky and power-hungry than their peer weapons, so enemy
    polities must usually choose between building small ships that are very
    effective at defeating other small ships, or building hunter-killers that
    can threaten cruisers but are at a disadvantage against their less
    specialized brethren.
