  description: >-
    The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew or
    passengers. Extended life support can be fitted multiple times; each time,
    the maximum crew rating of the ship increases by 100% of its normal maximum.
    Thus, a free merchant who installs this twice can have a maximum complement
    of 18 people.
