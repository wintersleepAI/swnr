  description: >-
    An extremely rare example of psitech dating from before the Scream, a
    precognitive nav chamber allows a character with at least Precognition-2
    psionic skill to assist in interstellar drills, sensing impending shear
    alterations before they happen. The navigator automatically succeeds on any
    spike drill check of difficulty 9 or less. On a failed check, add 2 to the
    Spike Drive Mishap roll, limiting the potential damage. On drilling in to
    the destination system, the psychic has expended all Effort in the process.
  effect: Allows a precog to assist in navigation
