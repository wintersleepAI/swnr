  description: >-
    Cruisers and larger craft can't land on planetary bodies, so they require
    small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only capable of
    surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly twenty minutes either way, but
    can latch on to a standard pressurized cargo container holding up to 200
    tons of cargo and passengers. These containers are usually collapsible and
    take up no significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they're
    not simply disposable cargo shells. This fitting can be purchased multiple
    times.
