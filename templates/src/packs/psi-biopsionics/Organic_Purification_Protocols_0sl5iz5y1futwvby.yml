  description: >-
    <p>The biopsion’s <em>Psychic Succor</em> now cures any poisons or diseases
    the subject may be suffering, albeit it requires Committing Effort for the
    day as an additional surcharge. Biowarfare organisms, exceptionally virulent
    diseases, or TL5 toxins may resist this curing, requiring a Wis/Biopsionics
    skill check at a difficulty of at least 10. Failure means that the adept
    cannot cure the target’s disease. This technique cannot cure congenital
    illnesses.</p>
