  description: >-
    You may or may not be good, but you are undeniably lucky. Once per game
    session as an Instant action, when something bad happens to you such as an
    injury, a failed save, or a botched skill check, test your luck and roll
    1d6. On a 1, the bad event is unaffected. On a 2-5, you somehow avert the
    consequences by blind chance. On a 6, it actually lands on an enemy or rival
    of the GM's choice, if that's possible. Only events that happened in this
    same round can be averted.
