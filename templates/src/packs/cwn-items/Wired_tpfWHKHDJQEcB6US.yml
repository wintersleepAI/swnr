  description: >-
    You may begin play with up to $200,000 worth of new or secondhand cyber. If
    secondhand, you roll once per system for its defect and may end up with
    unusable junk. You don't need to pay for installation and its maintenance is
    covered for the next two months. You can redeem this Edge later in your
    career by paying double the cost of the cyber you selected; if so, you can
    trade this Edge in for a different one with the GM's approval. See page 27
    for example packages of cyber you might pick to suit your character's
    concept.
