  description: >-
    You have multiple usable identities registered with corporate and
    governmental databases. These identities are so deeply embedded in the
    systems that they're almost impossible to pry out unless you do something to
    compromise them.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can
    maintain one alternate identity at a time per three character levels,
    rounded up. These identities have their own names, backgrounds, criminal
    records, financial dealings, and bank accounts, and will register as
    authentic to all normal corporate and governmental checks. If an identity is
    compromised or you want a different one, you can replace it with a week's
    work. False identities cannot be important people or involve corporations
    you don't have a Contact in already.<br />Level 2:
