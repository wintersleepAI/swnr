    "A skilled hacker can program their own utilities<br /><br />Level 1:  but
    you take this expertise far beyond the norm."<br />Level 2: Gain Program as
    a bonus skill. You can create and maintain an additional number of program
    elements equal to your character level+2, split among Verbs and Subjects as
    you see fit as explained in section 4.3.0. You can change your choices with
    a week's work. Once per day, as an On Turn action, you can make an
    on-the-fly edit to a Subject program element to turn it into any other
    Subject program element you need. The element remains altered until you
    change it again.
