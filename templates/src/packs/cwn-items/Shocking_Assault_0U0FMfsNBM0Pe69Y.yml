  description: >-
    You're extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your melee
    attacks stresses and distracts enemies even when your blows don't draw
    blood.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock
    damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10, assuming
    your weapon is capable of harming the target in the first place and the
    target is not immune to Shock.<br />Level 2: In addition, you gain a +2
    bonus to the Shock damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed attacks
    that do Shock. As usual, regular hits never do less damage than this Shock
    would do.
