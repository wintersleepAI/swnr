  description: >-
    A rare drug of desperation, Reset is a combination injector patch and
    wireless cyber override key. When applied to a willing subject with at least
    one Body or Nerve cyber system, it deluges the user's system with safety
    override commands and neurotransmitter stimulants. They lose all accumulated
    System Strain in excess of their permanent minimum. Five minutes later,
    their System Strain is maximized and they must make a Physical saving throw
    at a penalty equal to the number of System Strain they've gained since the
    drug was taken. On a success, they drop to 1 hit point. On a failure, they
    become Mortally Wounded. If their adjusted roll is 1 or less, they must make
    a second modified Physical save or instantly and unavoidably die. Using
    Reset more than once a week is invariably fatal.
