  description: >-
    (Heal-0) An emergency stimulant meant to shock a downed ally back into
    mobility, Lurch heals 1d10 damage plus the physician's Heal skill on
    application, adding one System Strain to the target. Each dose of Lurch
    after the first each day increases the required Heal skill by one, so the
    third dose requires Heal-2 to successfully administer. Lurch only works on
    conscious and stabilized targets; the shock will kill a Mortally Wounded
    subject that hasn't been made stable.
