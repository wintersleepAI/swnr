  description: >-
    A chemical that temporarily destroys a person's ability to form long-term
    memories, Control-Delete must be ingested in food or drink. Toxin-filtering
    cyber can fend it off, but it otherwise grants no saving throw. Once
    affected, the target will continue to act normally, but anything that
    happens to them between then and their next sleep or unconsciousness will be
    completely forgotten by the time they awake.
