  description: >-
    You have a gift with ranged weapons. While this talent most commonly applies
    to guns, it is also applicable to thrown weapons or other ranged weapons
    that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you can't use the
    benefits of the Armsmaster Focus at the same time as Deadeye.<br /><br
    />Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can Ready a Stowed ranged weapon
    as an Instant action. You may use a rifle or two-handed ranged weapon even
    when an enemy is within melee range, albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may add
    your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.<br />Level 2: You
    can reload guns, crossbows, or other slow-loading weapons as an On Turn
    action, provided they don't take more than a round to reload. You can use
    ranged weapons of any size in melee without penalty. Once per scene, as an
    On Turn action when target shooting at an inanimate, non-creature target,
    you automatically hit unless you roll a 2 on your Shoot skill check or the
    shot is physically impossible.
