  description: >-
    Drones that are not factory-equipped with weapon hardpoints can have one
    worked in as an aftermarket addition. The usual hardpoint limits on maximum
    allowed weapon size still apply, however, and this fitting counts as two for
    purposes of the drone`s maximum fittings.
