  description: >-
    Most commonly installed on small ground drones, this web can be armed as a
    Main Action by the pilot. Until disarmed, any attempt to grab or pick up the
    drone automatically inflicts 2d6 non-lethal electrical damage on the
    grabber. This shock continues each round as long as the drone is held, with
    up to 5 discharges total before the battery must be recharged. The firm
    contact required makes it impractical to use the web as an offensive weapon.
