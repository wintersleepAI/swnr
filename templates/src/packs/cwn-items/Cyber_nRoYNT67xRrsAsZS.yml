  description: >-
    A cybernetic system in a visible subject within 30 meters with no
    significant obstacles to line of sight. Unlike most Subjects, it's not
    necessary for a hacker to manifest an avatar inside the target node to
    affect cyber systems; they can launch their program directly at it, and the
    system itself need not be visible on the target's body. Given the difficulty
    of affecting cyber wirelessly, many hackers prefer to use more specific
    Subjects for a +1 bonus, such as Nerve Cyber or Limb Cyber.
