  description: >-
    Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives in the grip of the less
    gifted. Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to
    binding up opponents wielding pistols, rifles and similar ranged arms,
    though you need at least one hand free to do so.<br /><br />Level 1: Gain
    Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed attacks become more dangerous as your
    Punch skill increases. At level-0, they do 1d6 damage. At level-1, they do
    1d8 damage. At level-2 they do 1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does
    1d12+1. At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality equal to your
    Punch skill against AC 15 or less. While you normally add your Punch skill
    level to any unarmed damage you inflict, don't add it twice to Shock damage.
    If you choose to strike lethally with unarmed attacks, they have a Trauma
    Die of 1d6 and a Trauma Rating of x2.<br />Level 2: Even on a miss with a
    Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage, plus any Shock that the blow
    might inflict on the target. Your Trauma Die becomes 1d8 for lethal attacks.
