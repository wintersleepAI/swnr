  description: >-
    A chem that intensely stimulates a subject's memory centers, Madeleine has
    its dangers. Users normally focus on a particular memory before injecting
    the drug; for the next 1d6 hours, they relive some portion of that memory
    with perfect fidelity while remaining oblivious to their physical
    surroundings. Psychological addiction is a considerable risk for long-term
    users, as well as choosing a less pleasant memory to recall.
