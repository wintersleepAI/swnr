      Claim Territory: The plot is intended to take practical control of a
      particular area, making the plotter the de facto ruler of the place and
      neutralize the influence of other outside powers. The type of control is
      likely to depend on the nature of the plotter; a gang is probably
      interested in controlling the protection payments and use of violence in
      an area, while a megacorp might seek to systematically quash the retail
      outlets and government contracts of rivals in a zone.
